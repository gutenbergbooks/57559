<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION TO THE
TWILIGHT ANIMAL STORIES<br />

<small><span class="smcap">By the Author</span></small></h2></div>


<p>All little boys and girls who love animals
should become acquainted with Bumper the
white rabbit, with Bobby Gray Squirrel,
with Buster the bear, and with White Tail
the deer, for they are all a jolly lot, brave and
fearless in danger, and so lovable that you
won&#8217;t lay down any one of the books without
saying wistfully, &#8220;I almost wish I had them
really and truly as friends and not just story-book
acquaintances.&#8221; That, of course, is a
splendid wish; but none of us could afford to
have a big menagerie of wild animals, and
that&#8217;s just what you would have to do if you
went outside of the books. Bumper had many
friends, such as Mr. Blind Rabbit, Fuzzy Wuzz
and Goggle Eyes, his country cousins; and
Bobby Gray Squirrel had his near cousins,
Stripe the chipmunk and Webb the flying
squirrel; while Buster and White Tail were
favored with an endless number of friends and
relatives. If we turned them all loose from the
books, and put them in a ten-acre lot&mdash;but
no, ten acres wouldn&#8217;t be big enough to
accommodate them, perhaps not a hundred
acres.</p>

<p>So we will leave them just where they are&mdash;in
the books&mdash;and read about them, and
let our imaginations take us to them where we
can see them playing, skipping, singing, and
sometimes fighting, and if we read very carefully,
and <i>think</i> as we go along, we may come
to know them even better than if we went out
hunting for them.</p>

<p>Another thing we should remember. By
leaving them in the books, hundreds and
thousands of other boys and girls can enjoy
them, too, sharing with us the pleasures of
the imagination, which after all is one of the
greatest things in the world. In gathering
them together in a real menagerie, we would be
selfish both to Bumper, Bobby, Buster, White
Tail and their friends as well as to thousands
of other little readers who could not share
them with us. So these books of Twilight
Animal Stories are dedicated to all little boys
and girls who love wild animals. All others
are forbidden to read them! They wouldn&#8217;t
understand them if they did.</p>

<p>So come out into the woods with me, and
let us listen and watch, and I promise you it
will be worth while.</p>

<p class="ph2">BUSTER THE BIG BROWN BEAR</p>




<h2 class="nobreak">STORY I<br />

<span class="smcap">When Buster Was a Cub</span></h2></div>


<p>In the North Woods where Buster was
born, a wide river tinkles merrily over stones
that are so white you&#8217;d mistake them for snowballs,
if you were not careful, and begin pelting
each other with them. The birches hanging
over the water look like white sticks of
peppermint candy, except in the spring of the
year when they blossom out in green leaves,
and then they make you think of fairyland
where everything is painted the colors of the
rainbow.</p>

<p>The rocks that slope up from the bank of
the river are dented and broken as if some
giant in the past had smashed them with his
hammer, cracking some and punching deep
holes in others. It was in one of these holes,
or caves, that Buster was born.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t mind the hard rocky floor of his
bed a bit, nor did he mind the darkness, nor
the cold winds that swept through the open
doorway. He was so well protected by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
thick, furry coat that he didn&#8217;t need a soft
bed on which to take his nap. A big stone
made a nice pillow for his head, and he rather
liked the hard floor for a bed when he curled
up to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Buster was an only child. He didn&#8217;t know
what a brother or sister was like, and so he
didn&#8217;t miss either. He had his mother, who
was good enough for him, and when he was
old enough to crawl out on the rocks in front
of his home he would spend hours and hours
there playing with her in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mother Bear had to leave him
while she went off in the woods to get something
to eat. At such times she made Buster
stay in the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t show yourself on the rock,
Buster,&#8221; she cautioned, &#8220;until you hear me call
you. I won&#8217;t be gone long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was a dutiful little cub, and he accepted
his mother&#8217;s commands without asking
why or wherefore. Perhaps that was because
he was too young to understand, or because
his mother was very strict with her only child.
When he was very young, so young that he
could hardly see at all, his mother used to tell
him what to do and then gently but firmly
make him do it, using her big hairy paws to
enforce obedience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>These early lessons were never forgotten,
and Buster got in the habit of minding his
mother just as naturally as a tree grows
straight when trained upright to a stake. But
Buster grew curious as he got older, and one
day when his mother was going away he
asked: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I play in front until you
come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; replied Mother Bear, &#8220;Loup
the Lynx might come along and eat you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Loup the Lynx?&#8221; asked Buster,
turning very pale, for he had a wholesome
dread of being eaten up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, dear. You stay inside until
I come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a mighty argument of Mother
Bear&#8217;s to make her child obey. He was so
afraid of Loup the Lynx that he never dared
to poke his nose out of the cave when his
mother was away. And sometimes the temptation
to do it was very strong, for as he grew
bigger and stronger the sunshine had a great
fascination for him. Nothing in the world
seemed pleasanter than to roll around on the
rocks outside, blinking at the warm sun, and
smelling the odors of the sweet flowers. It
was springtime then, and the woods were full
of the song of birds and the drone of busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
insects. It made one wish to be outdoors all
the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be careful today, Buster,&#8221; his
mother said to him one morning, &#8220;and stay
inside the cave. I heard Loup the Lynx
hunting around here last night. I don&#8217;t like
him. He&#8217;s a rough, brutal fellow, and nearly
always up to some mischief. I hate to leave
you a minute today. But I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster kept his promise, and remained
inside all the morning, playing with his tail
and the few leaves the wind blew in the cave.
Toward noon, however, he got tired of this,
and also very hungry. When a bear is hungry,
he becomes very bold and will do things that
would never occur to him at other times.</p>

<p>Buster sniffed in all the corners of the cave
for a bite of something good to eat, but there
was nothing more digestible than rocks and
stones. Then he crept nearer the entrance,
venturing a little closer every moment.</p>

<p>A streak of sunlight played on the rocks
in front of him, and it so fascinated him that
he began trying to catch it with his little paws.
He had it, then lost it, and then sprang for it
again. But the sunlight danced around, and
never stayed caught.</p>

<p>In the midst of this game of tag with the
sunlight, Buster heard a noise outside. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
sounded like some animal scuffing heavily
over the rocks, and the little fellow was so
sure it was his mother that he ran out to greet
her.</p>

<p>But what a surprise met him! Instead of
Mother Bear there stood Loup the Lynx,
crouching and sniffing, with his long tail
swishing back and forth making a noise like
a nutmeg grater.</p>

<p>Buster had never seen Loup the Lynx before,
but nobody had to tell him now. He
recognized him instantly. His first thought
was to run back in the dark cave. Loup had
a great dread of being caught in the cave by
Mother Bear. If he had to fight with a full
grown bear he preferred to be out in the open
where he could spring in a tree if knocked
over by a big paw. So he resorted to cunning
to induce Buster to come out further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, Buster,&#8221; he said pleasantly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to hurt you. Your
mother was delayed in the woods, and she sent
me here to watch the mouth of the cave so no
harm would come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was surprised at this information,
and he stopped to look at Loup. He didn&#8217;t
like his face, but if his mother sent him it
must be all right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>&#8220;I was watching you playing with that sun-beam,&#8221;
Loup continued, lying down with his
two paws in front of him. &#8220;I used to do that
when I was young, but I&#8217;m too old now. I
can&#8217;t jump around as I used to. Now let me
see if you can catch the sun-beam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was less afraid than ever, and he
wanted to show Loup how spry he was. &#8220;I
can catch it if I want to,&#8221; he said boastfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you can. Now let&#8217;s see
you do it. If you do I&#8217;ll tell your mother
when she returns what a spry youngster you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster, swelling with pride and ambition,
made a dart for the flickering sun-beam. At
the same time Loup leaped into the air, and
landed right at the mouth of the cave, with
Buster on the outside. He was cut off from
retreat, and Loup leered so cruelly at him
that a spasm of fear ran down his spine. He
wished now that he hadn&#8217;t disobeyed his
mother, but it was too late, and he set up a
little cry of terror.</p>

<p>What Loup the Lynx did to him, and how
Buster escaped to plunge into more adventures,
will be told in the next story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY II<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster and Loup</span></h2></div>


<p>It was a dreadful position for a little rolly
polly bear to be in, with Loup the Lynx facing
him, and his mother away in the woods where
she couldn&#8217;t hear his cries. Loup was so sure
of his prize that he let him squeal and cry for
some time. It rather amused him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a little howling brat you are!&#8221; Loup
said finally. &#8220;Stop that squealing or I&#8217;ll
make you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was as much frightened by the tone
of the voice as by the words, and almost instantly
stopped calling for his mother. He
was a very young bear&mdash;a mere cub&mdash;and
you could not blame him for crying for help.
Besides he had never been outside of the cave
alone before, and right down in his heart he
knew that his disobedience of his mother&#8217;s
commands had got him into trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stop,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll please move
away from that doorway and let me go inside.
Mother told me not to come out of the cave
when she was away.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, she did!&#8221; sneered Loup. &#8220;Then
you&#8217;ve been a bad, wicked cub, and you deserve
to be punished. I think I&#8217;ll teach you
a lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t, Mr. Loup,&#8221; pleaded Buster,
who much preferred to be punished by his
mother than this wicked looking animal.
&#8220;One punishment will be enough, and I know
mother will attend to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loup laughed and swished his short tail as
if he wished it were longer so he might use it
as a whip to punish Buster with.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll punish you too,&#8221; he added. &#8220;You
deserve it. Do you know how I punish cubs
that disobey their mothers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster didn&#8217;t know, and wasn&#8217;t particularly
anxious to find out. His one desire was to
get back of Loup and escape in the cave where
he might be able to hide until his mother returned.
If he could only get Loup away
from the front of the cave, he might run in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; Loup added. &#8220;I take
them by the scruff of the neck, and shake them
until they haven&#8217;t breath enough to squeal.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grabbed a stone in his jaws and shook
it back and forth just to show how he would
do it. The sight made Buster feel faint.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; went on Loup, &#8220;I give them
a pat on the back with my paw like this.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Loup raised a paw and brought it down on
the rock so hard that it made Buster jump
a foot in the air. The blow was so powerful
that it seemed for a moment as if it would
crack the rocks. Loup laughed joyfully at
Buster&#8217;s fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve shown you what I intend to
do with you,&#8221; Loup continued, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be prepared.
Well, I&#8217;m coming now to punish
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster backed away to the edge of the rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when I&#8217;ve cuffed your ears, and
shaken out your teeth,&#8221; Loup threatened, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to eat you. Oh, yes, a young cub makes
delicious eating. I&#8217;ll fill my stomach with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time Buster showed a little
spirit of defiance. Standing up on his two
hind legs, he said, wagging his head: &#8220;No you
won&#8217;t, Mr. Loup, for my mother will kill you
first. She&#8217;s bigger than you, and she can
strike harder than you. My, when she brings
her big paw down it makes the rocks shake!
If you touch me she&#8217;ll strike you on the head,
and knock you in the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; snorted Loup angrily. The fact
was he was afraid of Mother Bear, but he
didn&#8217;t want Buster to know it, and he tried to
make him think so by boasting. &#8220;If your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mother should come near me, I&#8217;d knock her
over. I could do it easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps Buster wasn&#8217;t convinced by this
boastful talk, or may be he heard something
in the bushes that sounded like his mother&#8217;s
familiar footsteps. At any rate, he turned
suddenly, and clapped his paws.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let me see you do it, Mr. Loup!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Here comes mother! She won&#8217;t let
you hurt me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The way Loup jumped and growled showed
that his courage wasn&#8217;t so very great after all.
He had no desire to meet Mother Bear, and
the thought he had lost a delicious dinner by
talking so long to Buster made him hungry.
For a moment he hesitated. If he jumped
on Buster and ran away with him, Mother
Bear would be on his tracks immediately, and
if he stayed he would be cornered in the cave.
He decided to take the safest course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if your mother&#8217;s coming, Buster,&#8221;
he said in a changed voice, &#8220;it won&#8217;t be necessary
for me to stay here with you any longer.
You might tell her I kept guard over the cave
while she was away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was so surprised by these words that
he turned to look at the Lynx. Loup smiled
at him, and added: &#8220;Of course, you know
this was all a joke. I didn&#8217;t intend to hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you. I love little bear cubs. That&#8217;s why I
came here to protect you. We&#8217;ll always be
great friends, and when you grow up I&#8217;ll show
you the ways of the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster in his innocence believed these soft
words, and his feelings toward Loup took a
sudden change. He wasn&#8217;t wise enough to
follow up his advantage and let Loup go. Instead
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go yet, Mr. Loup. I&#8217;m not sure
mother is coming after all. The noise in the
bushes was just a bird scratching for worms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loup raised his ugly head and glanced
around him. His ears were cocked up so that
he could catch the faintest sound in the distance.
Then a smile of satisfaction spread
over his face. Turning to Buster he let out
a roar that sounded like distant thunder
rumbling in the sky. It made Buster jump
nearly two feet in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you were trying to deceive me!&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;You lied to me! You said your
mother was coming when she wasn&#8217;t. Then
for that I&#8217;ll kill you and eat you up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster started to protest. &#8220;No, no, Mr.
Loup, I didn&#8217;t lie to you,&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>But he couldn&#8217;t get any further. Loup had
crouched for a spring. Buster saw his big,
dark body coming through the air at him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
very naturally he ran away crying with fright.
Loup seeing that he had missed him in his
spring struck viciously with one paw, and just
grazed Buster&#8217;s head. It was only a graze,
but it drew blood, and made Buster whimper
with pain.</p>

<p>There was one thing Buster wanted, and
that was to get safely inside the cave, and the
moment Loup sprang in the air he started for
it. But Loup was a quick, powerful dodger,
and before the cub could reach the entrance
the Lynx had taken another long jump and
landed directly in front of him.</p>

<p>Buster, to escape him, wheeled so suddenly
that he rolled all over in a heap. The rock
sloped down toward the water, and the cub
rolled down it so fast that Loup was unable to
catch him. It was the only thing that saved
Buster&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>He had never been in the river, and he didn&#8217;t
know whether he could swim or not, but he
much preferred the water to Loup&#8217;s dripping
jaws. So instead of trying to check his rolling
he kicked out to make himself go faster.</p>

<p>Loup reached him just as he got at the edge
of the rocks, and with one paw tried to crush
his head and body; but again he missed him,
and merely cut a deep gash in Buster&#8217;s
shoulder. The next moment the cub splashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
into the river, and went down, down, down
until it seemed to him there was no bottom.</p>

<p>In the next story you will hear of how
Buster was rescued from the river.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY III<br />

<span class="smcap">How Buster Got Out of the River</span></h2></div>


<p>Buster had never been in water over his
head before, and you can imagine his feelings
when it got in his eyes, mouth, ears and nose.
He coughed and kicked, and made a great
splutter, but after all it was more fright than
real danger. He was such a fat little cub
that he couldn&#8217;t sink to the bottom, and stay
there.</p>

<p>Just when he thought his end had surely
come, he bobbed up on the surface, and his
head came out of the water. What a wonderful
thing it was to inhale pure fresh air again!
Buster had never realized how good it was
until then! Of course he had always breathed
all the air he wanted, and so having enough
he didn&#8217;t know what it meant to be without it
for even a few seconds. That&#8217;s the way with
a lot of things we have in this world.</p>

<p>Buster inhaled the air in great gulps, filling
his lungs until they swelled up like balloons,
and then to his horror he felt himself sinking.
The mere thought of going down in the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
again terrified him. He let out a squeal of
fear, and began splashing with all four paws.</p>

<p>That was the best thing he could do, for a
bear can swim without any lessons if he must
do it to save his life. But it was a laughable
sight to Loup the Lynx watching from the
shore. Buster&#8217;s swimming was clumsy and
awkward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! Ha!&#8221; laughed Loup gleefully. &#8220;Wag
your tail, Buster, and maybe that will help
you! Don&#8217;t sneeze now, or you&#8217;ll swallow all
the water in the river. That&#8217;s right, keep going
around in a circle.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was cruel of Loup to poke fun at him, and
Buster thought so too, but he was so occupied
in trying to keep his head above the surface
he didn&#8217;t have time to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come toward the shore, Buster, and I&#8217;ll
help you,&#8221; Loup called finally, running down
to the edge, and wading knee-deep in the river.</p>

<p>This was the first kindly offer of the Lynx,
and once more Buster began to think Loup
was not so wicked after all, but when he had
made his way a few feet toward the shore he
stopped. Why was Loup so anxious to save
him? Of course, there was only one explanation
to it. He wanted to eat him up.</p>

<p>Buster turned suddenly and splashed away
from the bank. Much as he dreaded death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
by drowning, he preferred it to being eaten
up by Loup.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way, Buster! This way!&#8221; called
Loup, thinking that the cub had got turned
around and didn&#8217;t know which way he was
swimming.</p>

<p>Buster made no reply. He saw the opposite
shore ahead. It was a long distance away,
but he was going to swim for it. He began
splashing harder than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you to swim this way!&#8221; added Loup,
growing suspicious and angry.</p>

<p>Buster continued to head in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come this way,&#8221; angrily cried
Loup, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come after you, and hold your
head under the water until you&#8217;re dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster more frightened than ever paddled
desperately, and he was really making pretty
good time. He was beginning to learn how
to swim. The opposite bank was growing
nearer every moment. To his surprise he
found that his strength was not leaving him,
and he could keep his head up better than
before. There was a chance of escaping the
Lynx.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little brat!&#8221; shrieked Loup, dancing
around in the shallow water. &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you
to trick me!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Loup was an excellent swimmer, but he
didn&#8217;t like the water. He hated to get his soft
fur wet, for it took a long time to dry it in
the sun. He never took a swim unless forced
to it either to catch his victim or to save his
life.</p>

<p>But this was one of those occasions when he
had to swim or lose his prey. Buster was
surely escaping him. In a few more minutes
he would be on the opposite shore where he
could hide in the bushes until his mother
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; added Loup finally, making
up his mind. &#8220;I&#8217;m coming for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>These words didn&#8217;t frighten Buster nearly
so much as the terrible splash he heard a moment
later behind him. It seemed as if the
river rose a foot, and that big waves were
dashing against the bank. Loup had run up
a tree leaning over the edge of the river, and
launched himself from it. When his body
struck the water it made a loud noise.</p>

<p>Buster made a frantic effort to increase his
speed, but once when he glanced over his
shoulder he nearly lost heart. Loup was
swimming with great powerful strokes which
brought him closer every second. He didn&#8217;t
splash and flounder around in the water as the
cub did, but, with all except his ugly head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and long tail under the surface, he moved forward
with the least amount of friction. Loup
swam as steadily and easily as a boat propelled
by a screw.</p>

<p>Buster grew frantic with dread. He expected
any moment to feel Loup&#8217;s powerful
paw crushing down on his head, for right behind
him he could hear the deep breathing of
the Lynx. There was no hope&mdash;no escape!</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought you&#8217;d get away from me, Buster,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; laughed Loup when within a
few yards of the cub. &#8220;Ha! Ha! This is
delicious sport! Now I&#8217;m going to duck you
and half drown you, and then duck you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, please&mdash;&#8221; gasped Buster, who
was pretty well winded now. &#8220;Please let me
go!&#8221;</p>

<p>For reply Loup laughed louder than ever.
Then Buster thought of a trick. This time
he made it up, for he had heard nothing in
the bushes to make him think his mother was
returning. But under the circumstances you
can&#8217;t blame him for stretching the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Loup, there&#8217;s mother coming!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I must go to her at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loup was not deceived this time. He took
a cautious peep around him, and then splashed
the water violently with his two front paws.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;You can&#8217;t deceive me that way the second
time, Buster,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your mother isn&#8217;t
coming. I&#8217;m going to kill you, and then take
you up on the bank and eat you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Loup, I haven&#8217;t done anything to
you. Won&#8217;t you let me go this time? I&#8217;ll
promise to be your friend, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; roared the Lynx so loudly that the
echo went ringing up and down the river.</p>

<p>He raised a great paw to grasp Buster, who
to escape it dove under the water and disappeared
for an instant; but he couldn&#8217;t stay
there long, and when he reappeared there was
the menacing paw raised to strike him.</p>

<p>Loup really liked to torture his victims. It
wasn&#8217;t his nature to kill them outright. It
gave him great pleasure to see them suffer.
If he had struck at Buster at once, he might
have killed him in one blow; but he didn&#8217;t,
and that was what saved the little bear&#8217;s life.
There was rescue at hand which neither one
dreamed of.</p>

<p>There was a sudden splash in the water, and
then a dull thud as something hard and heavy
struck Loup on the nose. He jumped back
with a scream of rage. At first he thought
Buster had played a trick on him, but when
another heavy thing hit him on the back of
the head he knew differently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>From the shore there came excited cries.
&#8220;Hit him again! Let me try him this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loup glanced that way, and understood instantly.
Two men were standing on the shore
pelting him with rocks. Two of them had
hit him, and others were coming his way.
There was no fight in Loup when caught in
the water, and with a scream of rage he turned
and swam for the opposite bank. He wasn&#8217;t
going to risk the loss of his life for the sake of
a good dinner.</p>

<p>The next story will tell how Buster met the
men, and was carried away as a captive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY IV<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster is Carried Away by the Men</span></h2></div>


<p>Buster was nearly as much surprised as
Loup by the sudden appearance of the men,
but he lacked the strength to turn and swim
back to the other side of the river. Indeed,
between fear and his hard struggle he was almost
ready to give up and sink. He felt he
couldn&#8217;t take many more strokes even to save
his life.</p>

<p>At first he thought the rocks were being
hurled at him, but as they followed Loup half
way across the river, the men throwing them
until the Lynx was out of reach, he concluded
that maybe he was safer on that side with the
men than on the other with his old enemy.
This belief was strengthened when the men
stopped bombarding the Lynx, and turned to
Buster.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a young bear!&#8221; said one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! I told you so before. We must
save him. Here, little fellow! Come here!
We won&#8217;t hurt you!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Buster looked at them with eyes that seemed
ready to pop out of his head. He was so
thankful that the men were not going to hurt
him that he swam straight toward them. One
ran out to meet him, and caught him in his
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor little fellow&#8217;s hurt,&#8221; the man
said, noticing the blood on Buster&#8217;s shoulder
where Loup&#8217;s claw had caught him when he
first tumbled in the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had a gun to shoot that Lynx,&#8221;
remarked the other. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come back and lay
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man holding Buster stroked his head
and back, as he carried him up on dry land.
&#8220;The poor little fellow&#8217;s tired out and half
dead with fright,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;And hungry, too,&#8221; said the second man.
&#8220;We must find him some warm milk. Got
any in the camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but condensed milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll try him with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>They carried Buster up to their camp in the
woods, and brought out a can of condensed
milk. After warming some of this over the
fire, they gave it to Buster.</p>

<p>Nothing ever tasted so good as that milk,
for Buster was cold, tired and still trembling
from fright and weakness. He didn&#8217;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
it until then, but he was dreadfully hungry, so
hungry that he couldn&#8217;t stop until he had
lapped up the last drop.</p>

<p>The two men watched him in silence, and
then patted him on the back. &#8220;You were
hungry, little chap, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221; remarked
one. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s enough for the present.
We don&#8217;t want to make you sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, give him a bit of this honey-comb for
dessert. That won&#8217;t hurt him.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then to Buster&#8217;s delight, the man
handed him something, the very odor of which
sent the blood tingling through his veins. One
taste of it, and Buster was in ecstasy. It was
his first taste of honey, and the grunt of pleasure
that escaped his lips sent the men into a
roar of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little chap&#8217;s having the time of his
life,&#8221; one laughed. &#8220;Like Oliver Twist he&#8217;ll
be begging for more when that&#8217;s gone.&#8221; Of
course, Buster didn&#8217;t know anything about
Oliver Twist, but he did know that he could
eat that delicious honey all day, and when the
last drop was gone he did beg for more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand on your hind legs and ask for it, and
I&#8217;ll give it to you,&#8221; said the man.</p>

<p>Buster didn&#8217;t know exactly what he meant,
but it was much easier to reach up to the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
containing the honey when he stood on two
legs, and he unconsciously obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now ask for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster opened his mouth and snapped at it,
but the hand was raised beyond his reach.
Then, disappointed, he uttered a little cry of
eagerness. To his surprise the man gave him
the honey.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he laughed. Then turning
to his companion, he added: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
teach him tricks, Jim. You can teach a young
cub almost anything if you begin early
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this was strange talk to Buster, but he
had learned the first lesson of his new life&mdash;the
trick of begging. After that when he
wanted milk or honey or anything else, he
stood up on his hind legs and grunted or cried
for it. He found that he always got what he
wanted in this way.</p>

<p>With his little stomach full of rich milk and
sweet honey, Buster grew very sleepy, and
when he curled up to rest one of his rescuers
spread a warm blanket over him. In a few
minutes he was lost in slumberland.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i035.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">He stood on his hind legs and cried for it</span></p>

<p>When Buster awoke he had a queer sensation
of being carried in a hammock or something
equally soft and comfortable. It was so
different from his hard bed on the rocks! His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
first thought was that it was all part of a
dream, but remembering his experience with
Loup the Lynx he shuddered, and set up a call
for his mother. He was frightened, and
whimpered so loudly that the man carrying
him opened the blanket and peeked in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Buster?&#8221; he asked, addressing
him by the very name his mother had always
called him. &#8220;Hungry again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was indeed hungry again, but he was
also homesick and wanted his mother. He
kept on whimpering when the man took him
out of the blanket and patted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, give him something to eat, Bill, and
stop his crying,&#8221; said the man&#8217;s companion.</p>

<p>So they stopped long enough to feed him
again, and after that Buster felt less homesick,
and, it must be confessed, forgot his
mother. The men began playing with him,
and Buster rolled over and gnawed at a stick
for them until they roared with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Jim,&#8221; said one of his captors,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got a rich prize in that cub. He&#8217;s
the most intelligent little chap I ever saw. I
wonder where he came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably his mother was killed, and that
Lynx knew it, and was trying to make a dinner
off him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to get a crack at that lynx some
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So would I. But I&#8217;m mighty glad we
saved the cub. He&#8217;ll make a fine pet. He&#8217;s
as playful as a dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was a little startled to hear that his
mother had probably been killed. That would
account for her not returning to the cave when
he called her. Had Loup killed her? No,
Buster didn&#8217;t think so, for his mother was big
and powerful, and could easily knock a lynx
over with one blow from her paw. Then who
was her murderer, or wasn&#8217;t she dead?</p>

<p>These questions were too hard for Buster to
answer, and he soon stopped trying to think
of them. Meanwhile, he was safe and well
fed, and his two captors liked him. Why
should he worry about something that couldn&#8217;t
be helped?</p>

<p>At night time the men came to a cabin near
the edge of the woods, and Buster was given
a warm blanket in one corner of it. He
watched them cook their evening meal, and
ate whatever they fed him. The bacon sizzling
in the frying pan smelt so good that
Buster poked his nose in it, and then drew
back with a howl of pain. It burnt his little
nose and brought the tears to his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>&#8220;Let that be a lesson, Buster, not to poke
your nose in things that don&#8217;t belong to you,&#8221;
laughed one of the men. Then he handed
him a piece of bacon well cooked, and not too
hot. Buster swallowed it in one gulp.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with the little
fellow, Jim?&#8221; suddenly asked one of the men.
&#8220;You know we can&#8217;t keep him in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that,&#8221; replied the other
slowly. &#8220;The only thing we can do is to sell
him. He ought to be worth something.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the first hint to Buster that he
wasn&#8217;t always going to live with his captors,
and it made him very sad. When bears were
sold, what became of them? Buster didn&#8217;t
know, and he went to sleep very troubled. But
he wasn&#8217;t sold after all, and in the next story
you will hear how he was stolen.</p>

<span class="smcap">How Buster Was Stolen</span></h2></div>


<p>Buster remained three whole days in the
camp with the two men who had saved him
from Loup the Lynx, and during that time he
learned many things that his mother had never
taught him. For one thing he learned manners.</p>

<p>One day he stuck his nose in the pot of soup
on the table and began licking it up until a
hand grasped him by the neck, and jerked
him back. &#8220;Buster, you&#8217;ve got to learn your
manners, and the time to begin is when you&#8217;re
young,&#8221; said the man who held him. &#8220;Now
I must punish you so you&#8217;ll never stick your
nose in the soup again without remembering
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that two sharp blows from a small
stick landed on Buster&#8217;s nose. He yelped
with pain, and tried to run away, but his captor
held him. &#8220;The next time you will get
three blows instead of two,&#8221; he added gravely.
Buster never repeated the offence.</p>

<p>For another thing he learned it paid to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
obliging. When the men asked him to jump
over a stick or dance on his hind legs, he received
a double lump of sugar if he promptly
obeyed. A little extra dance, or a new kind of
trick, always brought something to reward
him. Buster was shrewd enough to connect
the two together&mdash;the trick and the reward.</p>

<p>But there was one thing he hadn&#8217;t learned,
and it got him in trouble again just as it did
that day when he disobeyed his mother in leaving
the cave when she was away. The men
had to go away for a few hours, and they shut
Buster up in the cabin, with the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay in here, Buster, and watch the
camp. We&#8217;ll be back soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better close that window, Jim,&#8221; remarked
the other. &#8220;He might climb up to it and get
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it will be too hot in here. Besides, I
think we can trust Buster. He won&#8217;t try to
get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, when they left Buster had no
intention of disobeying. He was satisfied to
curl up in a corner of the cabin and sleep until
they returned; but they were gone for a long
time, and late in the afternoon he got very
restless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll climb up there and look out,&#8221; he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to himself, glancing up at the window. &#8220;They
didn&#8217;t tell me not to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>To reach the window he had to climb up
on the stout table, and jump from that to the
broad window-sill. This feat wasn&#8217;t so difficult,
for Buster had learned to use his claws
with great skill in climbing. The jump to
the window-sill was a short one, but he nearly
missed it, and had to scramble desperately to
prevent a fall.</p>

<p>Once on the window-sill, however, he was
well repaid for his trouble. It was a beautiful
day outside, and the woods smelt so sweet
and attractive that Buster felt a strange longing
to get out there and roll around among
the leaves. But he wasn&#8217;t going to do it.
No, he remembered the words of his captors,
and while he had made no promise he intended
to obey them.</p>

<p>Just the same when Groundy the Woodchuck
came along and cast a long shadow in
front of the window, Buster leaned so far out
that he nearly lost his balance. Groundy
glanced up, and at first was startled and ready
to run; but when he saw that Buster was no
more than a cub, only a little larger than
himself, he stopped and spoke to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing up there?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t live in that house, do you? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
you don&#8217;t look out the owners will come along
and catch you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve caught me already,&#8221; replied
Buster. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here, Groundy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then you&#8217;re a prisoner!&#8221; sighed
Groundy. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for you. Are you tied
by a chain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I&#8217;m not! They don&#8217;t chain me up.
I&#8217;m not a prisoner, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Groundy looked at him in silence, not quite
able to understand. Buster was grinning at
him as if he enjoyed his perplexity. Finally,
Groundy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you, Buster. But there&#8217;s
one way to show me. If you&#8217;re not a prisoner,
tied by a chain, climb down here. Then I&#8217;ll
believe you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; began Buster, and then stopped.
Of course, if he said that Groundy would go
away convinced that he was actually chained
inside the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; nodded Groundy. &#8220;Well,
I&#8217;m sorry for you. I must be going now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221; called Buster. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
climb down just to show you, but I can&#8217;t stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>It really wouldn&#8217;t do any harm, he thought,
to climb down and right back again to show
Groundy that he was free. He would do it
so quickly that he would be back in the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
again before any one saw him. Groundy was
waiting for him, and Buster couldn&#8217;t disappoint
him now.</p>

<p>He dropped easily to the ground under the
window, and cried: &#8220;How was that for a
jump, Groundy! You couldn&#8217;t do better,
could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but the thing that puzzles me is, how
are you going to get back again? Anybody
can jump down a hill, but not many can jump
up it. Can you jump back to the window-sill?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster had not given much thought to this.
He looked up, and the window was so high
above his head he knew that he could never
jump half the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;But maybe
I can climb back. I&#8217;ve got good claws,
and I can climb a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be, Buster, but you can&#8217;t climb
the side of a house,&#8221; replied Groundy. &#8220;If
you can I&#8217;ll watch you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Groundy squatted down, and Buster anxious
to show how well he could climb started
to go up the side of the house; but a bear
hugs a tree when climbing it, and Buster
couldn&#8217;t get his paws around the cabin any
more than he could fly to the moon. He
made several attempts to dig his claws in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
logs to pull himself up, but each time he
tumbled back to the ground before he could
reach half way. But he wasn&#8217;t going to give
up trying right away, and again and again he
made the attempt until completely exhausted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it, Buster,&#8221; remarked
Groundy finally, rising to his feet. &#8220;I knew
you couldn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s easier to roll down a hill
than roll up it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was greatly disappointed, and he
looked around to find something that he could
roll under the window and climb up that way;
but a noise in the woods suddenly startled
Groundy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone&#8217;s coming,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I
must be going. Better come with me,
Buster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I live here now,
and I won&#8217;t run away just because I disobeyed
and got in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been better for him
had he accepted Groundy&#8217;s invitation; but he
didn&#8217;t know that, and it was to his credit that
he stayed. He knew that he had done wrong
in climbing out of the window, but two
wrongs don&#8217;t make a right, and Buster decided
that he would face his masters and let them
punish him if they wanted to.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>But he received a severe shock the next
minute. A stranger appeared around the side
of the cabin, and another on the other side.
They were not pleasant looking. They were
very unlike the two men who had rescued him
from the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Head him off!&#8221; shouted one. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
him get away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster was too surprised and frightened to
run, and before he knew it he was caught by
four stout arms and something thick and
blinding was thrown over his head. He
grunted and squealed, but nobody seemed
to hear him. He was picked up and
carried swiftly away in the woods and for
a long time he was jounced and pounded
about in a thick blanket that completely covered
him.</p>

<p>When he finally got a peek of daylight
again, he was in a strange place, with two evil-looking
faces bending over him. In the next
story you will hear about Buster&#8217;s new masters.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY VI<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster&#8217;s Cruel Masters</span></h2></div>


<p>Buster was so enraged at the treatment he
had received that the moment one of the men
touched him he growled and snapped at the
hand. He had nearly suffocated in the
blanket, and all the way through the woods he
had been bounced and jounced around cruelly.
His captors had seemed to take delight in tormenting
him.</p>

<p>So you cannot exactly blame him for being
very angry when one of the men poked him in
the ribs with a hand. The hand was quickly
withdrawn the moment Buster snapped at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little beast,&#8221; snarled the owner of the
hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ll teach him to bite!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Buster knew what was coming, he
was slapped over the head with a stout stick.
It stunned him for a moment, and he lay very
quiet. But when he got back his senses, he
showed his teeth again and sprang for the
man.</p>

<p>This time he was knocked over and kicked
about the room until he ached in every bone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
His two captors came for him with short,
stout sticks, which they used freely. Again
and again Buster sprang at them, and tried
to bite them, but each time he was knocked
down.</p>

<p>You see, Buster was only a cub, and he was
no match for two full grown men, but he had
the spirit of his wild ancestors in him, and he
fought until he was hardly able to stand up.
Then he dropped down sullen and resentful,
beaten into silence, but with his spirit still
flaming with anger.</p>

<p>From that day began a new life for Buster.
He was no longer treated kindly and coaxed
to do tricks. Every time he failed to do what
his captors demanded of him he was kicked
and cuffed about, and when he obeyed them
he was not rewarded by any sugar or honey.</p>

<p>Indeed, he never tasted either of these
sweet things. What he had to eat were
scraps of bread or meat which the men threw
to him after they had eaten all they wanted.
Instead of having the freedom of a cabin, he
was kept chained up in a small, dark hut.</p>

<p>And what a hut it was! It was dirty and
smelly, with scarcely any sun or daylight in
it. At night time the men lighted a dirty old
lamp or a smelly candle which spluttered and
dripped without giving much light. His bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was the bare, hard floor, with nothing for a
covering except a few whisps of straw.</p>

<p>Buster rebelled at all this treatment. He
couldn&#8217;t get used to it. The men never spoke
a kind word to him, nor ever patted him on
the back in a friendly way. They whipped
him for the slightest thing, and made him so
afraid of them that finally he ran whenever
one of them approached.</p>

<p>But even this wasn&#8217;t the worst of his captivity.
In a short time his captors began to teach
him to dance and do tricks, but not in the
gentle way his former friends did. They put
a muzzle on his nose so he could not bite any
one, and tied a chain to his neck. Then with
a long pole, one end of which was sharpened,
they prodded him into dancing. If he didn&#8217;t
dance fast enough to suit them they jabbed
him with the sharp pole, and sometimes when
he was so tired he could hardly stand they
made him stand on his head and turn a somersault.</p>

<p>As a reward for all this Buster was given a
few dry crusts of bread and a drink of water,
but never any honey or sugar. At night time,
sore and tired, he would curl up in the corner
of his room, and think of the past. With tears
in his eyes, he thought of his happy home in
the cave, of his mother who was so kind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
him, of Loup the Lynx, and of the two men
who had saved him from the river, and fed
him with rich milk and sugar and honey.</p>

<p>Oh, how he wished he was back with them
or at home in the cave with his mother! But
wishing wouldn&#8217;t help him, and after a while
he began planning a way to escape. He decided
to be good, and obey his cruel masters,
but the first chance he had he would run away
from them.</p>

<p>After that Buster became a model bear. He
tried to please his masters, not because he
liked them, but because he was waiting for
the chance to run away. He was really a very
bright bear, and within a couple of months he
could do many tricks and stunts. He was
given a tin cup, which he was taught to hold
out to people, and when pennies were placed
in it he bowed and carried them to the
man with the pole.</p>

<p>One day he was taken out on the streets,
and was led along until they came to some
children playing. One of his masters played
a wheezy old organ, while the other shook the
chain and told Buster to dance.</p>

<p>Now dancing out in the fresh air, with children
watching him and clapping their hands,
was very much pleasanter than in his dirty
room, and Buster enjoyed it. He danced as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
never did before, and when the man holding
the chain told him to stand on his head and
turn a somersault he obeyed promptly.</p>

<p>There was a clapping of hands, and a shout
of pleasure came from all sides. Buster got
to his feet, bowed, and repeated the performance.
Then a little girl, holding the hand of
a gentleman, approached Buster and handed
him a stick of candy.</p>

<p>It was time for him to pass the tin cup for
pennies, but Buster was so pleased with the
little girl&#8217;s attention, and so hungry for something
sweet, that he forgot his duties and took
the candy. But before he could put it in his
mouth the man with the chain jerked him
back and prodded him with the sharp pole.</p>

<p>Buster grunted with pain and hurriedly
picked up the tin cup. A shout of anger went
up from the crowd, and the gentleman holding
the little girl&#8217;s hand spoke sharply to Buster&#8217;s
master. Then he picked up the stick of candy
and handed it to Buster, who took it and
tucked it in his mouth. How sweet and delicious
it tasted! It made him think of the
days when he was kept in the cabin with the
two campers who had rescued him from the
river.</p>

<p>Once more there came a jerk on the chain,
and the pole prodded him in the side. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
had forgotten to pass the tin cup for pennies.
The candy had made him forget his duties.</p>

<p>Now it was not Buster&#8217;s fault that the crowd
didn&#8217;t fill his cup with pennies. Indeed, it
was because they knew the money was to go
to the two men and not to Buster that the people
refused to pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t deserve anything!&#8221; somebody
said. &#8220;They&#8217;re cruel to the poor creature!
Don&#8217;t give them anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster made a complete circle of the double
row of men, women and children, but not a
penny was dropped in his cup. When he returned,
finally, and handed the empty cup to
his master he was greeted by an angry cuff.
There was an angry growl from the people,
and the men fearing trouble led Buster away,
jerking him hard with the chain.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t the last of his punishment.
That night when he got home Buster was sent
to bed without even his crust of bread. The
men were angry because he hadn&#8217;t collected
many pennies for them, and like many other
people in this world they laid all the blame
of their failure upon another. Buster was
the scape-goat.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, Buster thought
of the little girl who had given him the stick
of candy, and groaning with pain and hunger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
he made up his mind to run away very soon
and find the girl if he had to travel half
around the world. She would at least be kind
to him, and that was all he wanted. On the
very morrow he would plan a way to get out
of the hut and begin his search for the girl
with brown eyes and dimples in her cheek.</p>

<p>Buster gets away in the next story, but he
joined a circus instead of finding the little girl
who had been kind to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY VII<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster Makes His Escape</span></h2></div>


<p>Buster had been growing rapidly all this
time, and instead of being a little cub he was
nearly as tall as his mother and as broad as
a Newfoundland dog. A few months had
made a tremendous difference in his size and
strength.</p>

<p>But he was hardly aware of this change.
He still thought of himself as a little bear, but
had Loup the Lynx seen him now it is doubtful
if he would have been so free to attack
him. Loup had a wholesome respect for a
full grown bear. It was only the young cubs
that he liked to tackle and eat.</p>

<p>But if Buster wasn&#8217;t aware of his growing
size and strength his two captors were. That
was why they kept him chained up at night
and always carried a long pointed pole when
they took him out on the street. They were
afraid that some day Buster would realize his
strength, and then all would be up with their
control of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>The day came, however, when Buster suddenly
found that his muscles were powerful
and his strength greater than that of his masters.
They had been traveling all day from
one small town to another, gathering in a few
pennies here and there, and resting by the
way-side whenever opportunity offered. It
was a hot day, and the road was dusty and
rough.</p>

<p>When they came to a small brook the sight
of the cool, sweet water brought to Buster&#8217;s
mind pictures of the broad river that ran in
front of the cave where he was born. A great
desire to plunge in the stream and wallow in
the cool water seized him. With this idea in
mind he quickened his pace, and started down
the embankment.</p>

<p>A sudden jerk of the chain around his neck
brought him to his senses, but with an angry
toss of the head he continued on, dragging the
man behind him. In vain the man tugged at
the chain, shouting to his companion, who
came up and began prodding Buster with the
sharp end of the long pole.</p>

<p>But Buster wanted to get in the brook.
Nothing in all his life had ever appealed so
much to him. The dust and dirt in his mouth,
ears and nose irritated him. Instead of stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
he slapped at the pole and continued on
his way.</p>

<p>Then something happened that aroused him
to fury. The man gave him such a vicious
jab with the sharpened pole that it made him
grunt and squeal. Heretofore such cruel
treatment had always cowered Buster, but it
had an opposite effect on him now. It aroused
his fury.</p>

<p>With a quick, lightening-like stroke he
grasped the pole in his two paws, and before
either of his captors could recover from their
surprise he snapped it in two. It was all done
so quickly that even Buster was surprised.</p>

<p>Seeing the instrument of his torture lying
broken on the ground, Buster smiled, and
leered at the men. Something in their eyes
attracted his attention. It was fear! Buster
read it as clearly as if it had been printed
there in large letters.</p>

<p>His captors were afraid of him! They had
lost their pointed pole, and thus disarmed they
were no longer able to torment. Buster was
the master of the situation. A great feeling
of exultation swelled up in him. His eyes
gleamed and flashed.</p>

<p>Then with a roar he turned on the one
holding the chain and struck savagely at him.
What happened filled Buster with glee. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
man dropped the chain and fled with cries of
fright. Buster pursued a few yards, and then
sat down on his haunches and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho! They&#8217;re afraid of me!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t have to be their slave any more! All
I&#8217;ve got to do is to growl at them, and strike
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up and strutted around. He was a
free bear once more. Never more would he
be a captive. He waddled down to the brook
and plunged into the cool water. He washed
and drank and gurgled to his heart&#8217;s content.
Once or twice his captors approached, and
tried to coax him out, but he turned on them
with a snarl and made them run away again.</p>

<p>Then they disappeared entirely, and Buster
was left alone to enjoy his bath. But his freedom
wasn&#8217;t to last for long, although he didn&#8217;t
know it at the time.</p>

<p>Now as it happened there was a circus in
the town a few miles back, and his two masters
who cared more about the money value of
Buster than anything else, decided that it was
a good chance to make a bargain. They knew
that they would never be able to control their
half-grown bear once he had discovered his
strength and power. He was henceforth useless
for their work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>But a circus was different. Buster would
be valuable in the circus either as a trick animal
or as a dangerous man-eating creature
that had to be kept caged all the time. People
would pay money to view a bear that no man
could tame. Of course, Buster was no such
wild animal, and he had no intention of killing
any one, but the fact that he had broken
away from captivity and refused to be captured
again furnished the foundation for a
story that he was a wild, desperate animal that
could not be tamed.</p>

<p>Buster was lying on the grass near the
brook, enjoying a quiet snooze, when he was
startled by the appearance of half a dozen
men armed with sticks and pitchforks. He
raised his head and looked mildly at them.
Behind walked the two men who had cruelly
tormented him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; shouted one. &#8220;Look out for
him, or he&#8217;ll jump on you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster growled when he heard that familiar
voice, and rose on his two hind legs to face
the approaching crowd. Some of them
stopped and refused to go any further; but
two or three approached warily. They were
armed with clubs and pitchforks, but one of
them carried a long rope looped over an arm.
Buster didn&#8217;t know what this was for, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
turned his attention to the men with the clubs.</p>

<p>He growled and stepped toward them.
They retreated a few steps&mdash;all except the
man with the rope. He seemed cool and unafraid.
Buster eyed him curiously when he
raised an arm and twirled the rope over his
head. He even watched the rope circle in the
air and come toward him.</p>

<p>It was not until the rope looped over his
head and settled on his shoulders that he
understood; but it was too late then. The
man jerked it, and Buster felt something
around his neck that choked him almost to
death. He tore at it with his paws, but before
he could rip it off another from behind
caught him.</p>

<p>Buster fought fiercely for a few moments,
but when the men armed with pointed sticks
and clubs ran in and began prodding him
sharply every time he tore at the rope he began
to grow afraid again. He was no match for
all these men, especially when his neck was
being squeezed so that he could barely draw
a decent breath.</p>

<p>When he quieted down, the men stopped
prodding him, and Buster soon found that it
didn&#8217;t pay to fight against such heavy odds.
Only when his former captors came near him
did he growl and show signs of anger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Buster was led back a few miles and placed
in a cage with iron bars. There was plenty
of food and water in the cage, and he was glad
to get inside with the ropes off his neck.
Buster had joined the circus!</p>

<p>But would his new life be happier than the
old? Had he jumped from the frying-pan
into the fire, or were there days ahead when
he could enjoy life once more without the fear
of being beaten for every little mistake? He
didn&#8217;t know, but he slept soundly and peacefully
that night even if he was a prisoner in
an iron cage.</p>

<p>What happened to him in the circus will
form part of the next story, called Buster&#8217;s
First Public Appearance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY VIII<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster&#8217;s First Public Appearance</span></h2></div>


<p>The cage in which Buster was kept was
rather small, but it was clean and fresh, with
plenty of straw on the bottom, and a blanket
stretched on one side to shield him from the
draft. There were other cages in the place,
and after the first night he began to get acquainted
with their occupants.</p>

<p>On his right there was an old Lion, who
had lost most of his teeth and much of his hair.
He snored so loudly the first night that Buster
was twice awakened by what he thought was
the roll of thunder. When morning dawned
he asked the Old Lion if he always snored
like that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when I&#8217;m asleep, but when I&#8217;m awake
I snore like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Buster&#8217;s surprise he opened his mouth
and let out a roar that shook the whole place
and started every animal crying and snarling.
Spot the Leopard, who was caged on Buster&#8217;s
left, growled and spit ferociously as he sprang
from one side of his cage to the other. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Old Lion sat back on his haunches and
roared with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do that for?&#8221; asked Buster,
when the wild commotion began to subside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just to show you how I snore in the day
time,&#8221; was the retort. &#8220;You want to hear it
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, once is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you say so, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the
Old Lion. &#8220;But after you&#8217;ve been here a
long time you&#8217;ll be glad to hear me roar. It
breaks up the monotony. There&#8217;s nothing
else to do, you know, and it gets dreadfully
tiresome doing nothing. Heigh-o! it&#8217;s a dull
life!&#8221;</p>

<p>He yawned and stretched himself. Spot
the Leopard on the other side stopped his
snarling, and glanced between his bars at
Buster. He was interested in this new-comer,
and he continued to stare so long that Buster
finally smiled back at him and nodded his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they catch you?&#8221; Spot asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a rope,&#8221; replied Buster. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t
expecting it, and they dropped it over my head
before I could run.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spot spit and snarled again to show his temper.
&#8220;They caught me when I was a cub,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he said. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t have caught me if
I was full grown. They&#8217;re afraid of me now.
Every time my trainer comes in I snarl and
snap at her. She snaps the whip in my face,
and I pretend to be afraid of it. But I&#8217;m not!
I&#8217;m just waiting my chance. Some day I&#8217;ll
pounce on her, and then&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He swished his long tail and licked his lips,
while his eyes glowed balefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a trainer have you?&#8221; asked
Buster. &#8220;Is she good to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There she comes now,&#8221; whispered Spot.
&#8220;You can see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster turned and saw a young woman,
dressed in a dazzling, sparkling costume of
many colors, with a small cap surmounting
her golden hair, and a thick, rawhide whip in
her hand. There was a fearless look in the
dark eyes, and when she strode up to Buster&#8217;s
cage she surveyed him quite calmly. Buster
returned her stare, and blinked two or three
times.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look so ugly,&#8221; the woman said
finally, addressing one of the attendants. &#8220;If
I know anything about bears, I should say he
was naturally good-humored. But of course
you can&#8217;t tell. His temper may have been
ruined by some one. His name is Buster, you
say?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>She walked up to the cage and stuck a hand
between the bars and patted the shaggy head.
&#8220;Well, Buster, we&#8217;re either going to be friends
or enemies,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Which is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster couldn&#8217;t reply right away, so surprised
was he, but unconsciously he stuck out
his tongue and licked the hand. How soft
and velvety it felt! Instead of drawing the
hand away, she permitted him to lick it again.
Then she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see,&#8221; she said, speaking to the attendant,
&#8220;he&#8217;s answered my question. We&#8217;re
going to be friends. Now open the door for
me. I&#8217;m going inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Buster was surprised, but not
nearly so much as the attendant. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do
it, Chiquita,&#8221; he said in alarm. &#8220;He&#8217;s not to
be trusted. He&#8217;s a vicious brute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chiquita smiled and put on her gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I need your advice, Billy,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;when it comes to training animals? Now
please open the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Chiquita, you will wait until I summon
the attendants to protect you if he attacks
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going in now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the door herself and stepped in
the cage. Buster watched her with eyes of
admiration and surprise. He had no fear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
her. This dainty little creature could not hurt
him. Indeed, she looked so slight and helpless
that he felt more like protecting her than
hurting her.</p>

<p>She came up to him and rubbed his nose.
He grunted with pleasure. Then she patted
his head and talked to him in a low, sweet
voice. Then she asked him to get down, and
when he obeyed she sat on him. She touseled
his head, opened his mouth and stuck a hand
in it, and finally patted him again, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right, Billy, as harmless as a kitten.
We&#8217;ll put him in the circus tonight in
place of poor old Bowser.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy, the attendant, wasn&#8217;t convinced of the
wisdom of this course, and shook his head, but
Chiquita laughed and walked out of the cage.</p>

<p>Buster didn&#8217;t know just what they meant,
for he had never been in a circus before, but
that evening he learned.</p>

<p>He was wheeled into a brilliantly lighted
place and stopped alongside of a big circular
cage containing nearly a dozen other animals.
There was the Old Lion, Spot the Leopard,
Boar the Hound, Timber the Wolf, Ocelot the
Jungle Cat, and several others which he did
not instantly recognize.</p>

<p>His coming started up a commotion among
the animals, for just like people they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
curious and inquisitive. They eyed him furtively
and sniffed at him. But without noticing
them he waddled across the big cage and
took a vacant place near the Old Lion.</p>

<p>Then something happened that dazzled
him. The curtain around the big circular
cage disappeared, and a sea of human faces
were visible on every side. The lights went
up, and the whole place seemed like a wonderful
picture.</p>

<p>The next moment Chiquita entered the cage,
holding her whip in one hand and a flag in
the other. She gave a few sharp orders and
the animals began to pose, dance and run
around. It was all new to Buster and a little
confusing, but he tried to follow and imitate
the others. Apparently this pleased Chiquita,
for she patted him once, and whispered in his
ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done, Buster! You&#8217;re doing splendidly!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster noticed that Spot the Leopard was
often surly and ugly, refusing to obey until
Chiquita hit him with the whip. This made
him mind, but it didn&#8217;t improve his temper
any. His surliness made the others nervous,
and once they got all snarled up and confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Spot,&#8221; cried Chiquita, &#8220;I&#8217;ll punish
you if you don&#8217;t behave. Now take that!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>She gave him a sharp rap over the nose with
her whip. It stung and enraged Spot, who
cowered back a moment, and then crouched
for a leap. Chiquita saw what was coming,
but she didn&#8217;t flinch. She snapped the whip
in his face again, but this time the trick didn&#8217;t
work.</p>

<p>Spot flung himself through the air in a
mighty leap, uttering a low savage growl,
which excited the other animals so they set up
a wild roar. Attendants ran to the cage with
long irons and sticks in their hands, but Chiquita
was penned against the iron bars, vainly
trying to hold Spot off at arms&#8217; length. There
was a great shout outside, and everybody stood
up, with fear and horror in their eyes.</p>

<p>In the midst of the confusion, Buster
suddenly came to life. He had taken no part
in the commotion, but when he saw Spot attacking
Chiquita, whose white face and appealing
eyes were turned toward him, his
anger flared up. He would not stand by idly
while the Leopard tore and scratched the
white flesh of his friend.</p>

<p>With a low growl, Buster started across the
cage, baring his teeth in an ugly grin, and
holding aloft a paw ready to strike. The
other animals stood aside to let him pass, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Spot was snapping and snarling at Chiquita
so that he did not see him.</p>

<p>How Buster saved Chiquita from Spot the
Leopard, and won her undying friendship,
will be told in the next story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY IX<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster Saves Chiquita</span></h2></div>


<p>Spot the Leopard had attacked Chiquita so
suddenly that she had little chance of defending
herself, and the other animals, excited by
the commotion, were ready to join in the attack
against their fair trainer.</p>

<p>Buster had not been in the circus long
enough to learn the ways of the other animals.
Chiquita had been kind to him, and after the
cruel treatment from his former masters it
seemed as if the dainty young trainer was more
than a friend to him. He recalled Spot&#8217;s
threat to pounce upon Chiquita some day and
punish her.</p>

<p>Buster resolved, as he crossed the cage in a
few long strides, to protect Chiquita, and if
necessary to fight Spot the Leopard. He was
angry with Spot, but not so much as to inflict
serious injury on him. It was only when he
got close and saw the deep scratch on Chiquita&#8217;s
arm where the Leopard&#8217;s claws had
laid the flesh open, that his anger flared up to
white heat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>With a deeper growl than before, he raised
his right paw and delivered a telling blow on
Spot&#8217;s body. It was not intended as a knock-out
blow, but Buster had grown to powerful
proportions, and his most playful cuff was
enough to do considerable damage.</p>

<p>It landed with a deep thud on Spot&#8217;s side,
and the Leopard was hurled to the other side
of the cage with a bang. He struck the iron
bars, and for a moment seemed too stunned or
surprised to utter a sound. Buster calmly
stood in front of Chiquita and glared defiantly
at his enemy.</p>

<p>Spot recovered his senses after a while and
let out a growl and screech that made every
one in the circus shudder. He crouched down
low, swishing his tail, and glaring at Buster.
It was a moment of intense suspense.</p>

<p>To make matters worse the other animals
kept up their uproar. The fight had stirred
their blood, and they began crouching and
stalking about the cage as if anxious to get in
the fray. Ocelot the Jungle Cat in particular
showed great excitement. He began creeping
upon Buster from behind, and Timber the
Wolf sneaked in closer to get a chance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i075.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">He raised his right paw and delivered a telling blow on Spot&#8217;s body</span></p>

<p>Buster through the corner of his eyes noticed
the restless, threatening motions of the
two. Boar the Hound ran around, barking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
vigorously, but made no attempt to take any
part in the fight. The Old Lion, who was too
sleepy and indolent even to roar, sat apart as
if he was to be the judge of the contest.</p>

<p>Chiquita, who was slightly wounded, cowered
back of her defender, unable to get her
whip or to make her voice heard. A thousand
spectators outside watched with horrified eyes
the combat. Attendants were running around
with long poles and irons to prod the animals
back to their corners, but they were so excited
they did little good.</p>

<p>Suddenly Spot the Leopard took advantage
of a moment when Buster was watching Ocelot
the Jungle Cat. He sprang at his enemy like
an arrow from a bow. At the same instant
Ocelot closed in, and Timber the Wolf
watched for his opportunity.</p>

<p>But Buster hadn&#8217;t been taken off his guard.
He had kept one eye on Spot, and when he
shot through the air that powerful right paw
of his was raised again. It caught Spot in
mid-air. It was no gentle blow this time. It
was delivered with all the force that lay behind
those powerful shoulder muscles.</p>

<p>It landed on Spot&#8217;s body with such a thud
that it could be heard in every corner of the
great circus. The Leopard was hurled back
against the iron bars with such force that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
seemed for a moment as if they would give
way. Spot grunted, and dropped to the floor
in such a dazed state of mind that he couldn&#8217;t
think or act.</p>

<p>Buster having delivered this knock-out blow
turned swiftly to Ocelot, whose claws had sunk
into his shaggy leg. The huge paw came
down on Ocelot&#8217;s head and nearly crushed the
skull. He dropped his hold and lay down as
if suddenly struck by lightning.</p>

<p>Buster, smarting with the pain in his leg,
growled in rage, and turned to Timber the
Wolf. Now Timber was naturally a coward.
The punishment meted out to Spot and Ocelot
immediately caused him to change his mind.
He ran around the cage as Buster started in
pursuit.</p>

<p>A temper, once it gets beyond control, is a
terrible thing to have. It may lead into all
sorts of trouble. Buster by this time had lost
his completely. He was so enraged that he
wanted to kill everything in the cage. His
eyes grew blood-shot and terrible to look at.</p>

<p>He lunged at Timber, and missed him, but
the Old Lion happened to be in the way.
Buster gave him a side cuff that made him roar
with pain. It was a glancing blow. If Old
Lion hadn&#8217;t been so old that most of his teeth
were gone he would have struck back, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Buster would have been in a peck of trouble.
He didn&#8217;t know much about lions in those
days.</p>

<p>The next animal that got in his way was
Boar the Hound, which he sent whimpering
across the cage. Then he came to Spot, who
was just recovering his senses, and with an
angry snarl hit him again and stood before
him like a cat over a mouse as if defying him
to run or strike back.</p>

<p>Round and round the cage Buster pursued
the animals, striking right and left, and
tumbling them all in a heap whenever he got
within striking distance. Ocelot climbed to
the top of the iron bars and crouched there in
shivering terror.</p>

<p>Timber the Wolf leaped and jumped over
the backs of the others, and thus escaped serious
injury. It was a mix-up that threatened
to end in a terrible tragedy. Buster was master
of the situation, and so enraged that he
continually saw red. The pandemonium outside,
and the quickly thrusting sticks and irons
of the attendants, had no effect on his temper.
He ignored the noise, and merely snapped and
snarled at the sharp irons every time they got
in his way.</p>

<p>Then Chiquita, who had been cowering in
her corner in fright, suddenly regained control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of her nerves. She picked up her whip,
but did not use it. Instead she walked calmly
up to the enraged bear, and said sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster! Buster!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster stopped short as if pricked by a
needle. When his name was repeated in that
soft voice, he closed his dripping jaws and
ceased growling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster, come here!&#8221; added Chiquita.</p>

<p>It was a soft, soothing command, and it fell
on Buster&#8217;s excited nerves like cooling balm.
He looked at Chiquita, and then without so
much as a grunt waddled toward her.</p>

<p>What followed made every one in the vast
audience gasp. Chiquita, ignoring her danger,
suddenly put her two arms around
Buster&#8217;s neck, and actually wept on his shaggy
breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster, you saved my life,&#8221; she said gently.
&#8220;Spot would surely have killed me if you
hadn&#8217;t come to my help. You dear old
Buster!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster&#8217;s emotions cannot be described. All
his rage suddenly vanished. He put a paw
on Chiquita&#8217;s shoulders, and then fearful of
hurting her, dropped it to his side.</p>

<p>She raised her head from his breast, and
added: &#8220;Now come with me. Take me outside.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>And leading Buster she walked across the
cage, opened the door and stepped out.
Buster meekly followed. Outside she led him
by a paw across the arena, and faced the great
audience. &#8220;You have seen what happened,&#8221;
she said in a clear voice. &#8220;Can you wonder
that I love Buster the Bear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The audience went wild, shouting and waving
to them, and Buster was so confused he
hardly knew what to do. In the next story
Buster becomes a famous trick bear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY X<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster Becomes a Trick Bear</span></h2></div>


<p>Buster was not popular among the animals
of the circus after his fight with Spot the
Leopard, but he was a great favorite with the
circus people. From being regarded as a
dangerous bear, ready to kill his trainer at
any moment, he was looked upon thereafter
as a special pet who could be trusted by every
one.</p>

<p>Of course, it was Chiquita who favored him
the most. She bestowed more attention upon
him than on any of the others. She petted him,
praised him, feeding him dainties, and giving
him the softest bed in the place. She even
permitted him to roam about the rooms she
occupied, and as Buster did not get in mischief
or do any harm his liberty was extended day
by day.</p>

<p>Buster grew as fond of Chiquita as she was
of him, and he obeyed her as meekly and willingly
as a pet dog. None of the ugly temper
he showed when fighting Spot in the cage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
showed itself again, and Chiquita began training
him for trick performances.</p>

<p>Buster had already received a little training,
and he was quick to pick up his new lessons.
He soon learned to jump through a hoop, skip
rope, and turn somersaults back and forth.
Then one day, Chiquita said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You would make a good clown, Buster, I
believe. Yes, you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not knowing what a clown was, Buster
merely grinned and nodded his head. Chiquita
made a wonderful dress for him out of
red, white and blue flannel, and with a tall hat
on his head Buster looked like the cartoon of
Uncle Sam. Dressed as the goddess of liberty,
Chiquita appeared in the arena walking
arm in arm with her escort.</p>

<p>This brought great applause from the audience,
and what pleased the people pleased
Buster. He grinned and nodded his head,
and strutted around with his head high in the
air.</p>

<p>All the time he was receiving special favors
and attention, Spot the Leopard and Ocelot
the Jungle Cat were in their cages watching
for an opportunity to get revenge on him.
The pain they suffered from Buster&#8217;s hard
blows was nothing to what they suffered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
mind and spirit. They were nearly consumed
with rage and envy.</p>

<p>Buster never passed near the cage without
their snarling and spitting at him. They
could do this in safety, for the iron bars were
between them. Right down in their hearts,
however, they were afraid of him.</p>

<p>Buster, who carried no spirit of ill-feeling
against them, merely grinned when they spit
at him. But one day he stopped in front of
Spot&#8217;s cage, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you forget and forgive, Spot?
This carrying a grouch around with you all
the time spoils your face. Let&#8217;s be friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; snarled Spot. &#8220;I may think of
that after I&#8217;ve clawed off some of your hide!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me too!&#8221; echoed Ocelot. &#8220;And I&#8217;d like
to begin with your eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll lap up his warm blood when
you&#8217;ve killed him,&#8221; growled Timber the Wolf
from his cage.</p>

<p>Buster, instead of being offended at these
threats, sat back on his haunches and laughed.
Then noticing the Old Lion watching them,
his eyes blinking sleepily, he turned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you like to do to me, Old
Lion?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, Buster, except to give you some
good advice,&#8221; was the reply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s a friendly offer. I&#8217;ll listen to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Old Lion winked and blinked,
stretched himself with a yawn, and then sat
up looking for all the world like the noble
king of the beasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;When your enemies threaten you, Buster,&#8221;
he said slowly, &#8220;it is wise to listen to them so
you may be prepared. Don&#8217;t let the pride of
strength deceive you. The mouse gnawed
through the net that the lion couldn&#8217;t break,
and Cobra the Reptile put a whole jungle of
animals to flight. That is all, Buster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Old Lion,&#8221; replied Buster.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember what you said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any difference to me
whether you remember it or not,&#8221; was the answer,
as the Old Lion stretched out and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>Buster did remember the advice for a few
days, and then forgot it. He also ignored
Spot and Ocelot, for they refused to make
friends with him. Meanwhile, his progress
as a trick bear increased, and he appeared
nightly before big audiences with Chiquita.</p>

<p>One day the big tent was taken down, for the
circus was to move to another town. There
was such noise and confusion that every one
was upset. Buster found his customary resting
place filled with packing boxes and baggage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Somewhat put out by this he wandered
around, and finally climbed on the top of a
bundle of canvas away from the confusion.</p>

<p>It was a soft, comfortable bed, and Buster
soon fell asleep. He snored and rolled around
in his slumber until attendants came running
up to find out what the trouble was. When
they discovered him, they laughed and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only Buster taking his mid-day snooze
with the high treble stops wide open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster hadn&#8217;t noticed that the pile of canvas
was close to the two cages where Spot and
Ocelot were kept. They had kept so quiet
that he never suspected their nearness. But
the Leopard and Jungle Cat had seen him, and
were watching him with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>As he snored and rolled around in his sleep,
they kept their eyes patiently and watchfully
on him. Once a shaggy paw came close to
Spot&#8217;s cage, and he stealthily put out a fore-arm
to see if he could reach it. He fell short
about an inch.</p>

<p>He withdrew his paw silently and resumed
his watchful waiting. Ocelot on the other
side was equally interested in one of Buster&#8217;s
fore paws. It was within a few feet of his
cage.</p>

<p>Buster rolled over and flung his legs out to
their full length like an animal stretching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
The result was just what the two vengeful
enemies were waiting for. Spot reached
through the bars of his cage and caught the
hind leg of Buster with his sharp claws, and
Ocelot attacked one of his fore-legs.</p>

<p>Buster was aroused from his sleep by sharp
pains that seemed like a thousand needles
sticking in him. When he attempted to spring
to his feet he found himself a prisoner. Spot
and Ocelot were tugging, tearing and biting
with all their might as if they would pull him
apart and haul him through the bars of their
cages.</p>

<p>Taken at such a disadvantage, Buster for a
moment was helpless. Then the pain became
so severe that he brought all of his powerful
muscles into play, and jerked with such force
that both cages came tumbling over on top of
him.</p>

<p>The sudden upsetting of their cages startled
Spot and Ocelot so that they jumped back in
fright. Buster was immediately on his feet,
rolling the cages around as if they had been
made of jackstraws. With a lightning blow
through the bars he struck Spot a whack that
sent him reeling backward. Then before he
could recover, Buster sprang around on the
opposite side and knocked him back. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
moment it looked as if he would break through
the cage and kill Spot.</p>

<p>When the attendants ran up, Buster was
shaking Ocelot&#8217;s cage in a vain endeavor to
get at him. The Jungle Cat was so frightened
that he shivered and whined for mercy.
Buster&#8217;s anger could not be quieted until Chiquita
came up. She patted him, and led him
away to bind up his wounds. The Leopard
and Jungle Cat were glad to see him go. In
trying to get revenge on Buster they had been
punished nearly as much as he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have remembered the Old Lion&#8217;s
advice,&#8221; Buster said to himself when Chiquita
bound up his wounds. Then looking at her,
he added: &#8220;But there&#8217;s some good in everything.
I wouldn&#8217;t have such a tender nurse
if I wasn&#8217;t wounded.&#8221; And he smiled with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Next will come the story of how Buster was
caught in a railroad wreck.</p>

<span class="smcap">Buster in a Railroad Wreck</span></h2></div>


<p>The circus was preparing to move into its
winter quarters, and it was the confusion of
packing that caused Buster to get mixed up
with Spot and Ocelot in their cages. His injuries
were very slight, and within a few days
after Chiquita had bound them up his legs
were as good as new.</p>

<p>He felt a little angry at the Leopard and
Jungle Cat for attacking him when fast asleep,
but Buster wasn&#8217;t the kind to nurse a grudge.
When his wrath cooled a little he actually
laughed at the occurrence. Strolling outside
to where the cages were standing, he grinned
at the Leopard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got a good dig at me, Spot,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but with that last cuff I gave you I guess we
can call it even. Head ache yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Spot didn&#8217;t reply, but paced his narrow cage
in restless dissatisfaction. Buster turned to
the Jungle Cat.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about you, Ocelot! Got over your
scare yet? I didn&#8217;t touch you, but you looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
as scared as a rat in a trap when I shook your
cage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ocelot showed the same silent contempt
and refused to reply other than with a low
snarl. Buster turned to Old Lion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only cheerful one I find in this group
is you, Old Lion,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Spot and Ocelot
don&#8217;t look happy, and Timber the Wolf
acts as if he had an ingrowing pain in his
stomach. How about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always cheerful,&#8221; replied Old Lion.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve grown bald and toothless,
and lived to a good old age. Spot and Ocelot
will die young if they don&#8217;t change their manners.
So will you, Buster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; stammered Buster, &#8220;I do try to be
cheerful. I didn&#8217;t know I was anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; replied Old Lion, &#8220;but
you&#8217;re too ready for a fight. Every battle you
get in shortens your life by so many days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fight unless I&#8217;m attacked,&#8221; was the
quick reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know the animals attacked you
the other night in the circus. You started the
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but not until after they had attacked
Chiquita,&#8221; Buster said indignantly. &#8220;I had
to protect her, for she was a friend of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&#8220;Are you going to fight to protect all your
friends in this world?&#8221; asked Old Lion sleepily.
&#8220;If you do, I predict you will die young.
Now I must go to sleep, for we begin our long
journey soon, and I do hate riding on a train.
It rasps my nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster never knew how seriously to take the
Old Lion&#8217;s words, but he was a companionable
and harmless old fellow, and sometimes
rambled on just to hear himself talk. He was
getting so old that talking was the easiest thing
to do, and between eating and sleeping that
was about all he did. Sometimes he appeared
in the circus as a fierce old lion, who had
killed any number of keepers, but it was growing
harder and harder for him to assume the
pose. He wasn&#8217;t fierce looking at all, except
when he roared, and that was such an exertion
he seldom did it unless prodded by the attendants.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it feel to ride on a train?&#8221; Buster
asked when he saw that the Old Lion was
going to drop off asleep right before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it feel?&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;Why,
it feels as if all the bones in your body were
rattling, and when the train stops&mdash;and it&#8217;s
stopping all the time when it isn&#8217;t going&mdash;you
stand on your head and then on your tail, and
if you&#8217;re lucky you don&#8217;t die of fright.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&#8220;It must be a wonderful experience,&#8221; remarked
Buster.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, and you won&#8217;t enjoy it. I don&#8217;t know
what trains were invented for unless it was to
torture those who ride in them. But when
we get there we&#8217;ll have a long rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Buster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where we&#8217;re going, and when you get there
you wonder why you came, and where you are.
Now do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster laughed good-naturedly, for his
quizzing was making the Old Lion irritable.
He wanted to sleep and Buster strolled away,
leaving him to enjoy his nap.</p>

<p>The next day the animals were taken aboard
the train. Some of the harmless ones were
led there and tied to posts in box cars, and
others like Ocelot and Spot were lifted aboard
in their stout cages. No chance could be
taken with them.</p>

<p>Buster found himself in a small compartment
of a baggage car, with Chiquita occupying
a seat just forward of him. She trusted
him so much that she liked to have him near
her. But as he had never been on a railroad
journey before he was fastened in the car by
a chain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might forget yourself, Buster, or get
excited, and try to jump off when the train was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
moving,&#8221; she said to him, when chaining him
up. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t trust you. You
understand that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster nodded his head, as she patted him,
and looked at the chain. It was not a very
strong one, and he smiled at the thought of
what he could do to it if he wanted to escape.
He could snap it in two with one jerk of his
powerful body.</p>

<p>The train started finally, and Buster was as
interested and excited as a child on her first
railroad journey. The jolting and rattling
began almost at once. He recalled Old Lion&#8217;s
words, and wondered if he was groaning in
agony. Such rolling and jerking were enough
to rattle Old Lion&#8217;s teeth loose. And Spot
and Ocelot! How did they like the noise and
confusion?</p>

<p>The train steamed along slowly at first, and
then faster. Through a window in the baggage
car Buster could see the houses and trees
flashing past as if they were all running in the
opposite direction. It was a funny sensation.
Instead of being frightened by it, Buster enjoyed
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never ran so fast in my life,&#8221; he said to
himself. &#8220;Even Loup the Lynx couldn&#8217;t run
as fast as this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>He stopped and scowled. He never thought
of Loup without growing angry. The Lynx
had treated him in a cowardly, cruel way, and
Buster somehow wanted to punish him for it.
But there seemed little prospect of his ever
meeting the Lynx again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; Buster sighed, &#8220;I can&#8217;t spoil
my temper thinking of something that happened
in the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still right down in his heart he had a great
desire to go back to the woods where he had
been born. Perhaps his mother was alive yet,
and he would dearly like to see her again.
How surprised she would be to find him
grown up, fully as big as she, and far more
powerful!</p>

<p>Suddenly in the midst of these thoughts
there came a grinding shriek outside, and the
most fearful of explosions. Buster raised his
head to listen, and then he was thrown against
the opposite side of the baggage car with such
force that the chain snapped. Everything began
to break and fall down upon him, the
whole roof of the car collapsing.</p>

<p>Stunned by the fall, and unable to understand
what had happened, Buster lay there a
moment in silence. Everything was quiet
after that awful noise, but wild shrieks of Ocelot,
Spot and other animals soon filled the air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Then came the deafening hiss of steam, and
shouts and cries of men.</p>

<p>What had happened! Buster was curious
to know what all this noise meant, and finding
himself loose, with no roof over him, he
climbed out of the wreck. It was dark outside,
but there were many lights flashing
around.</p>

<p>Buster walked down the track where a
group of men were at work. They paid no
attention to him, and he sat down to wait.
Chiquita would come along soon to claim him.
But he waited and waited, and nobody paid
any attention to him. Finally, he got up and
wandered off in the fields, and before he
stopped he was lost and couldn&#8217;t find his way
back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll sleep here until morning,&#8221; he
said, seeking a good resting place under a tree.
&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll find my way back to the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it wasn&#8217;t the train he found. It was
the little girl who had given him candy that
day he danced for pennies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY XII<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster Meets the Little Girl Again</span></h2></div>


<p>When Buster woke the next morning the
sun was just peeping above the trees. He had
slept so soundly that he couldn&#8217;t recall right
away all that had happened the previous night.
He opened his eyes, and was surprised when
he found that nothing around him was familiar.</p>

<p>He grunted and rose to his feet, blinking at
the sun. Then it all returned to him. He
remembered the jolt and crash, and the splintering
of the roof of his car. He rubbed his
head to see if the bruise still hurt him, and
winced when it pained him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what happened to the Old Lion,&#8221;
he said, grinning. &#8220;He must have lost all his
teeth last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he thought of Chiquita. If she was
in the wreck, too, she may have lost something
more than her teeth. Suppose she had lost
her life! This thought grieved Buster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go back and find out,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll miss me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>He waddled away through the bushes until
he came to a road that was unfamiliar to him.
Which way did he go to reach the railroad?
He started up it, but hadn&#8217;t gone far before
he saw a man approaching, carrying a basket
on his arm. Buster was less alarmed than the
man apparently, for with a shriek of terror
the latter dropped his basket and ran up the
road so fast that he was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a foolish thing to do,&#8221; laughed
Buster. &#8220;He must have had an evil conscience
or he wouldn&#8217;t be frightened like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waddled up to the basket the man had
dropped. One sniff at its contents made his
heart jump with joy. It was filled with nice
fresh bread, rolls, and two blackberry pies.</p>

<p>Buster didn&#8217;t consider it stealing. The
man had left the basket, and it belonged to any
one who found it. He was very hungry, but
bear-like or boy-like (I don&#8217;t know which to
call it) he began with the blackberry pies instead
of the bread. He ate them up rapidly,
stuffing them in his mouth with both paws.
When they were gone he looked through the
basket for more.</p>

<p>The bread didn&#8217;t taste nearly so good after
the pies, but Buster was still very hungry, and,
not finding any more dessert, he began slowly
munching the bread. If there had been soup,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
I suppose, he would have ended his meal with
that.</p>

<p>After eating a dozen rolls, and one loaf of
bread, he felt better. A noise up the street,
accompanied by loud shouting, suddenly made
him stop and listen. Perhaps the man who
owned the basket was returning with help.</p>

<p>Buster decided that he wouldn&#8217;t wait until
the men appeared, and taking a loaf of bread
in each of his front paws he climbed over the
fence and disappeared in the woods. Long
before the men reached the spot he had made
his way into the heart of a big swamp where
he sat down and finished his meal.</p>

<p>He felt so much better by that time that he
took a long drink from the brook, and then
resumed his journey. He came out of the
swamp on the opposite side, and seeing a hill
climbed to the top. He hoped to get a view
of the railroad from there.</p>

<p>But when he reached it he saw no signs of
it. There was a small cluster of houses on his
right, a swamp and woods behind him, and
open country on his left, with here and there
a farm house. Buster decided to keep away
from the village.</p>

<p>The farm houses attracted him, for he could
hear the crowing of a rooster off in that direction
and the cackling of geese. There was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
moo of a cow and the neighing of a horse from
one barn-yard, and the barking of a dog from
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t bother the dog,&#8221; Buster said, keeping
away from that farm-yard. &#8220;They&#8217;re
harmless, but very annoying.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waddled across a field and climbed a
fence until he stood in the barn-yard of the
nearest farm. After reaching the barn he
poked his head in the open doorway. A boy
was in there milking a cow. Buster watched
the streams of milk, and a sudden desire to
taste milk again made him forget all caution.
He stepped across the threshold, a pleasant
grin on his face, and a rollicking smile in his
eyes.</p>

<p>But the boy didn&#8217;t see anything friendly in
either the grin or the twinkling eyes. When
he glanced up and caught sight of Buster, he
sat on his milk stool as if paralyzed, and then
recovering himself he let out a shrill cry and
darted for the opposite door. He disappeared
like a flash, leaving the milk pail behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How foolish of him!&#8221; said Buster. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t hurt him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up the milk pail and held it to
his lips. There was a gurgle, gurgle as the
milk ran down his throat, and it never stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
until three whole quarts were emptied in his
stomach.</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes me feel better,&#8221; he said, rubbing
his fat stomach. &#8220;I&#8217;m so full now I can
hardly walk. I&#8217;m sleepy, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hay-mow overhead attracted him.
How pleasant it would be to rest and sleep
there! He was going to climb up the ladder
for this purpose when a great noise outside
alarmed him. He peeked out, and saw a big
crowd of men and boys armed with sticks,
axes, pitchforks and shot-guns, running toward
the barn.</p>

<p>Buster decided to leave, for he had no desire
to meet the crowd. While his enemies
came in the front door, Buster ran out of the
back one, crossed an orchard, and reached a
field beyond before he was discovered. He
had a long start of them, but when they caught
sight of him again they began to blaze away
with their shot-guns.</p>

<p>Buster was an excellent runner, and he
made good time. Ahead of him was a bigger
house, with a wide lawn in front, and a garden
in back. Buster wasn&#8217;t going to enter this
place, but another crowd of men appeared in
front of him. If he kept on he would run
right into their arms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Buster darted to the right, crossed the lawn
and reached the back of the house. There
was no one around, and Buster hunted for a
hiding place. There was an open window
over his head on the second story of the house,
and a low shed leading up to it.</p>

<p>Buster suddenly decided that was his best
hiding place, and up the shed he climbed,
scrambling to the roof and crawling across this
to the open window. He looked inside, and
seeing no one he entered.</p>

<p>He was breathing hard, for after eating so
much, his exertions told on him. This noise
must have awakened the little sleeper on the
bed, for suddenly she rose up and startled
Buster so that he nearly fell down in a faint.
He supposed the room was empty, and here
was a young person staring at him. He
stared back, grinning foolishly. He felt
very much like a boy who had been caught
stealing.</p>

<p>Then to his surprise the girl clapped her
hands, and said: &#8220;Oh, I believe you&#8217;re Buster!
Yes, I know you are! And I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Until then Buster hadn&#8217;t recognized the
little person. Now he remembered her. It
was the little girl who had offered him a stick
of candy that day he danced for pennies on the
street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>But what pleased Buster more than anything
else was her joy. She wasn&#8217;t a bit afraid of
him! She wasn&#8217;t going to run away and
scream for help. She wouldn&#8217;t hand him
over to the men pursuing him with shot-guns.
What a relief to him this was! She was surely
his friend, and would protect him just as Chiquita
had done so many times. He grinned
with pleasure, and waddled toward the bed.</p>

<p>How the little girl outwitted the men, and
saved Buster from them, will be told in the
next story.</p>

<span class="smcap">Buster and the Little Girl</span></h2></div>


<p>Instead of showing fear when Buster approached
the bed, the little girl held out a
hand, and when he was near enough she took
one of his shaggy paws and patted it. This
seemed natural enough to Buster, for he could
not understand why any one should be afraid
of him, and Chiquita had done the same thing
many times; but to most little girls perhaps it
would seem like a brave and fearless thing.
This little girl like Little Red Riding-Hood
was not afraid of bears or wolves until they
tried to eat her up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Buster,&#8221; she said with
quaint gravity. &#8220;But how did you ever get
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster grinned and turned his head toward
the open window. The little girl followed his
gaze, and instantly understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you came through the window,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;That makes it so much more interesting.
Fairies and elves always come through
open windows. Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Buster was quite tired after his hard run,
and was very glad to accept this invitation.
The foot of the bed seemed a very inviting
seat, and he sat on the white coverlet.</p>

<p>But almost immediately he sprang up in
alarm. The springs creaked under his great
weight, and for a moment it looked as if the
whole bed would collapse. He jumped to his
feet with a queer expression on his face. In
fact, he wasn&#8217;t sure but this was some sort of
a trap set for him.</p>

<p>But the little girl laughed merrily at the
accident, and clapped both hands. He could
not believe she was attempting to deceive him,
and he grinned like a foolish boy who had discovered
a bent pin in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Buster,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I guess this isn&#8217;t
a <i>bear</i>-bed. You&#8217;re too heavy for it. Maybe
the chair will hold you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster turned and looked at the chair. He
seemed a little doubtful, but he wanted to be
polite. He tried it carefully, but when it began
to crack and groan under his weight he
was wise enough not to go any further. He
shook his head, and put the chair back in its
place.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i110.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">He didn&#8217;t mind the floor as a seat</span></p>

<p>The little girl shrieked with laughter again.
It was very amusing to her, and Buster, not
wishing to offend her, grinned and nodded his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
head. He liked children, and this one was
anxious to play with him. After a while she
grew serious again, and looked around at
every article in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Buster,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;but
you&#8217;ll have to sit on the floor. I don&#8217;t think
anything else is strong enough to hold you.
It&#8217;s not very polite to ask visitors to sit on the
floor, but what else can I do, unless you prefer
to stand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster didn&#8217;t prefer to stand. He was very
tired, and he didn&#8217;t mind the floor as a seat at
all. In fact, it was more suitable to him than
a bed or chair. So he squatted down on his
haunches, and smiled. Even then his head
towered above the little girl&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you comfortable there?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Buster nodded. &#8220;Then,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you
must tell me where you came from, and how
you escaped those cruel men. I want to hear
the whole story. It&#8217;s better than a story from
a book, and I love story books about bears.
Did you ever hear the story of Goldy Locks
or the Three Little Bears? No. Then I&#8217;ll
tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she didn&#8217;t have time. Just then there
was a great commotion outside. Men were
shouting and calling, dogs barking, and a great
hullabaloo going on under the open window.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that!&#8221; exclaimed the little girl,
hopping out of the bed, and running to the
window in her bare feet.</p>

<p>Buster could have told her what the noise
meant, and for a moment he thought it was
his duty to give himself up to keep the little
girl from being harmed. Suppose the crowd
searching for him should hurt her! He got
up, and tried to pull her away from the window,
but she pushed him back quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back, Buster!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;They&#8217;re
looking for you, but they won&#8217;t have you.
They mustn&#8217;t see you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The dogs below were barking. They had
tracked Buster to the woodshed, and were now
holding their nose up in the air baying loudly.
As plain as words they were saying the bear
had climbed to the roof of the shed.</p>

<p>The men saw the open window, and immediately
a hoarse cry rose. &#8220;He&#8217;s gone in
that window! He&#8217;s eating up little Nell!
Oh! Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>You could imagine Buster&#8217;s emotions when
he heard this outcry. To be accused of eating
up little Nell was enough to make any
self-respecting bear angry. He growled savagely,
and started for the window again. But
the little girl restrained him once more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;No, no, Buster, you mustn&#8217;t let them see
you!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Now let me think! What
ought I to do? They&#8217;ll be here soon. Yes,&#8221;
glancing out of the window, &#8220;they&#8217;re climbing
up the shed. Oh, Buster, hide under the
bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster obeyed, but he might just as well
have tried to crawl through the key-hole of
the lock on the door. He couldn&#8217;t possibly
squeeze under the bed without upsetting it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; added Nell, biting her lips,
&#8220;where can I hide you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at the closet filled with her
pretty clothes. She ran to it and looked in.
It was such a small closet that Buster couldn&#8217;t
possibly crowd in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Buster,&#8221; she added, &#8220;what I
can do.&#8221; She looked at her trunk. No, of
course, not; she couldn&#8217;t get Buster in that.
The bureau next, and then the wash-stand.
Not one of them was big enough to hold one
of Buster&#8217;s hind legs.</p>

<p>They could hear the men climbing to the
roof of the shed now. In a few moments they
would appear at the open window with their
shot-guns and pitchforks. The little girl was
more excited than Buster. Suddenly an idea
came to her, and she gasped with delight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;Here, Buster,&#8221; she called sharply, seizing
him by a paw. &#8220;You must lie down on the
floor at the foot of the bed. Get way down!
No, no, not that way! This way! Pull your
legs up like a cat cuddling up before the fire.
There, that&#8217;s right. Now don&#8217;t you move or
make a sound. You hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook a finger warningly at him. She
had made Buster curl up on the floor at the
foot of the bed in the smallest space he had
ever before occupied. It was not a comfortable
position for him, but for the little girl&#8217;s
sake he was satisfied to stay there.</p>

<p>Then Nell pulled the clothes down, and
threw them over the foot-board of the bed and
spread them out on the floor until Buster was
completely covered. She laid the pillows on
top just as if they had been put there to air.
She had been taught to do this every morning
after rising, and then open the window for the
fresh air to blow in.</p>

<p>The men appeared at the window just as she
had finished. Without waiting for an invitation
they climbed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; they asked. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the
bear? We thought he was in here eating you
up, Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were glancing all around the room,
and if Buster hadn&#8217;t been so well concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
they would have seen him. Nell turned to
them with dignity, and said in her high little
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;What an idea! Is there a bear around
here? Oh, I&#8217;d dearly like to see him! I
know he wouldn&#8217;t hurt me! Where did he
come from? Is he outside?&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran to the window and looked out.
Satisfied now that Buster was not in the room,
the men climbed out, but they closed the window
after them, and said: &#8220;Keep that shut,
Nell!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the next story Buster is discovered in the
house.</p>

<span class="smcap">Buster Tries to Escape and is Discovered</span></h2></div>


<p>When the men left the room and closed the
window after them, Buster and the little girl
felt greatly relieved. Satisfied that the bear
had not climbed in the open window, the
searching party turned their attention elsewhere.
But the danger wasn&#8217;t over yet, and
Nell knew it. She patted the top of the bed-clothes,
and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet a little longer, Buster. Here
comes some one up the stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster grunted and lay as still as a mouse.
There was a knocking on the door, and when
the little girl opened it her father appeared.
He was very white and trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bear that escaped from the railroad
wreck is roaming around here, Nell,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I was terribly afraid he had climbed up the
shed to your room. I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her and seemed greatly relieved
to find his daughter safe. He crossed the
room and looked out of the window. Then he
returned to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re safer here until they find
him,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Stay right here in your
room, and keep the door and window locked.
I&#8217;ll come and tell you when they find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl could have laughed in her
glee, for this was just what she wanted. She
was terribly afraid Buster would smother under
all those clothes and make a noise. She
couldn&#8217;t get her father out of the room quick
enough.</p>

<p>When he was gone, and the door locked, she
ran to the bed, and threw back the clothes.
Buster was all curled up just as she had left
him. But he was fast asleep! It was a warm,
comfortable bed, and after his long run and
heavy breakfast of pies, rolls, bread and milk
it had seemed impossible to keep his eyes open
for long. And the moment he closed them he
was sound asleep.</p>

<p>The little girl sat down on the floor, and
laughed until the tears streamed down her
cheeks. Buster woke with a start and blinked
at her. He couldn&#8217;t for several minutes imagine
where he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Buster,&#8221; she exclaimed finally, &#8220;I
thought you were being smothered to death,
and you were so comfortable you fell asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster struggled to his feet and began
chuckling. It made him happy to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
merriment of the little girl. She pulled the
clothes up and flung them back on the bed.
She was a very prim little housekeeper, for
she was not satisfied until the pillows were
brushed off and patted in position and the
sheets and covers carefully smoothed out.</p>

<p>Buster watched her in silence, and then in
his clumsy way offered to help, but he pulled
the clothes so hard, and made such a general
mess of it, that he stopped when the girl sat
down and laughed again at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw anybody so clumsy, Buster,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t help any more. You
sit down there in the middle of the floor until
I&#8217;m through. Then we&#8217;ll have breakfast together.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment she uttered these words she
stopped. Have breakfast together? How
could she arrange that? How, in fact, could
she manage to get Buster any breakfast without
somebody discovering him in her room?</p>

<p>What did bears eat anyway? And how
much? Goodness, from the size of him, he
might eat her father out of house and home!
The little girl felt terribly distressed all of a
sudden. She had saved Buster from his pursuers,
but now that she had him what was she
going to do with him?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>You couldn&#8217;t keep bears in a bed-room or
closet, nor could you chain them up in the
back yard like a dog? Everybody would be
afraid to visit the house, and all the servants
would leave. What could she do?</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster, haven&#8217;t you any home you can go
to?&#8221; she asked suddenly, turning to him.
Then she remembered what her father had
told her. The train carrying the circus animals
had been wrecked, and some of the people
and animals killed. Of course, the circus
people would like Buster back again, but was
he happy there? Or did he run away because
they treated him cruelly?</p>

<p>&#8220;Buster, do you want to go back to the circus?&#8221;
she added after a pause. &#8220;For if you
do I&#8217;ll have to tell them you&#8217;re here, and if
they want you they&#8217;ll call for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Buster had no desire just then to return
to the circus. He thought it would be
much nicer to live with the little girl and
play with her. So he shook his head vigorously,
which made the girl sigh, and say solemnly:
&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t have to go back!
I&#8217;ll keep you here!&#8221;</p>

<p>She cleaned up things in the room, and
dressed herself. Her breakfast was waiting
for her downstairs, and if she didn&#8217;t go soon
her father would be up after her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>&#8220;Buster,&#8221; she said once more, laying a hand
on his head, &#8220;I&#8217;m going down now to get my
breakfast, and then I&#8217;ll bring you something
to eat&mdash;some sugar and coffee, and jam and&mdash;and&mdash;what
do you like to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster only grinned and shook his head.
The little girl was puzzled. &#8220;I know what
I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; she added, smiling. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask my
father. He&#8217;s wise and knows everything, and
he&#8217;ll tell me what bears eat. I know he&#8217;ll like
you, Buster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, Buster wasn&#8217;t quite so sure of
this, but he had no way to express his doubts.
He heard the little girl running down the
stairs, and then for a long time he was left
alone. It was a queer situation for him. He
walked across the room, and the floor squeaked
with every tread. Then he looked out of the
window and immediately ducked his head, for
there was a man and dog below on guard.</p>

<p>He waited a long time for the little girl to
return, and then grew restless. He tried the
door, and finding it unlocked opened it and
stuck his head out. All was quiet in the
house. He couldn&#8217;t hear any one around.</p>

<p>A great fear that something had happened
to the little girl suddenly made him very anxious.
Perhaps the men and dogs had captured
her, and were holding her because she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
had hid him in her bed-room. This thought
made him angry. If she was in trouble and
needed him, he would go to her assistance.</p>

<p>Buster closed the door softly behind him
and started down the stairs. Now that he was
going to the little girl&#8217;s assistance he wasn&#8217;t
afraid of anything. He hadn&#8217;t been afraid to
attack all the animals in the big cage when
Chiquita was in danger. Then why should
he be afraid now!</p>

<p>Down, down the stairs he clumped, his
great weight making each step squeak and
groan. Nobody was in the hall below, and the
whole house seemed quiet and deserted. Had
the men taken the little girl away with them?
Buster uttered an angry growl and took another
step down.</p>

<p>Then directly in front of him appeared a
man. He stepped out of a doorway so suddenly
that both bear and man were surprised.
Buster recognized him immediately as the
gentleman who held the little girl&#8217;s hands that
day she fed him a stick of candy.</p>

<p>The man started suddenly, stared at the
bear on the stairs, and backed slowly away.
&#8220;Nell! Nell!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Keep away! Go
back! The bear is in the house! Run for
your life and tell the men!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>But little Nell, instead of running away,
pushed past her father and surprised him so
that he nearly dropped down with fright.
She ran straight up to Buster and hugged him.
Then laughing she turned to her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only Buster, and he wouldn&#8217;t hurt me.
Why, he&#8217;s been in my bed-room all the time!&#8221;</p>

<p>What they decided to do with Buster after
that will be told in the next story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STORY XV<br />

<span class="smcap">Buster is to be Sent to the Zoo</span></h2></div>


<p>It seemed almost like a fairy story to the
little girl&#8217;s father when she told him how
Buster had climbed through the window of
her room, and how she had covered him up
with the bed-clothes to protect him from the
men. And he didn&#8217;t believe in fairy stories!
In fact, he didn&#8217;t believe just then that he was
awake and hearing things. It surely was all
a dream.</p>

<p>But there was Buster on the stairs, and his
little girl hugging the great big, shaggy creature.
Why, with one blow the bear could
crush the life out of her! It made him tremble
to think of it. He tried to call her away, but
she didn&#8217;t hear him. She was talking to
Buster, who seemed to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, papa, you see he won&#8217;t hurt me,&#8221;
she said finally, &#8220;and I won&#8217;t let the men hurt
him. We must do something for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, dear,&#8221; was the stammering reply.
&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we keep him here?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>The man smiled for the first time. &#8220;Where&mdash;&mdash;in
your bed-room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o, but maybe outdoors. I think he
likes outdoors the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, dear, he would never be happy here,
and he&#8217;d frighten all of our neighbors. He
may be good to you, but he might be ugly to
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if they were kind to him,&#8221; was the confident
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not! Maybe not! But we must
think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was quiet for a moment, watching
Buster out of the corner of his eyes. He was
less afraid of the bear than at first. Something
in his eyes made him think that perhaps
his little girl&#8217;s trust was not misplaced after
all. But he had a natural fear of all wild animals,
and did not like to run any risks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, dear,&#8221; he added finally, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
put Buster in the cellar until the men have
gone, and then&mdash;then we&#8217;ll telegraph to the
owners of the circus. They will come for
him, and he&#8217;ll be better off with them than
with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But maybe he ran away from the circus
because they were cruel to him,&#8221; protested
Nell. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to go back then.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that, but I read in the
papers that the circus people are going out of
business. Their loss of animals in the smash-up
decided them to give up the show business.
Chiquita, their famous trainer, was injured so
she&#8217;ll never go back to performing again. I
believe she&#8217;s in the hospital now, and won&#8217;t be
out for a month or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now all this was news to Buster. They
couldn&#8217;t understand how eager he was to learn
all about the circus. If Chiquita was injured
in the wreck, then perhaps Spot and Ocelot
and Old Lion were hurt, too, or even dead.</p>

<p>It made him very sad, for it meant the end
of his circus life. He would never want to
perform for another trainer now that Chiquita
was gone. Poor Chiquita! Buster shed a
tear for her, for she had been his dear friend,
and he knew now that he couldn&#8217;t help her or
ever see her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, papa,&#8221; broke in little Nell again,
&#8220;we can keep Buster, can&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few days, dear,&#8221; was the smiling
reply. &#8220;We have no place to keep him, and
I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d soon try to escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl pouted, and looked anxiously
at Buster before speaking. &#8220;Then what will
become of him?&#8221; she added. &#8220;He won&#8217;t have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
any home at all. That will be dreadful, papa,
and he&#8217;s been so good to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed her father suddenly, his
eyes brightening. &#8220;I have it. We&#8217;ll send
him to the Zoo. We&#8217;ll make them a present
of him if the circus people don&#8217;t come to
claim him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl was not exactly sure that she
approved of this, and she continued pouting
and looking at Buster. &#8220;But won&#8217;t they shut
him up in a cage, and keep him there all the
time?&#8221; she queried. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like
to be caged forever and forever, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was addressed to her father,
but Buster answered it with a vigorous shake
of the head. He didn&#8217;t know anything about
the Zoo. It was a place he had never heard
about, but if they kept bears caged up there
all the time he didn&#8217;t care to know more about
it. It certainly was a dreadful place.</p>

<p>He had often pitied Spot and Ocelot for
being shut up in their cages all the time, but
he blamed them a good deal for that. They
wouldn&#8217;t behave themselves decently, and it
served them right. But that was no reason
why he should be kept in a cage all the rest
of his life. No, he preferred to be free.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; Buster heard the father say
after a pause, &#8220;that is the only wise thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
do. Keeping him here is simply out of the
question. We must put him in the cellar until
I can notify the authorities. Then they&#8217;ll put
him in a cage at the Zoo, and you can go and
see him as often as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thought of being able to see Buster at
the Zoo made her feel better, and she turned
and whispered to him: &#8220;I&#8217;ll come every week
to see you, Buster, and I&#8217;ll bring you sugar
and peanuts and candy, and everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster smiled, for he knew that she meant
what she said, but he was greatly troubled in
mind. Could he, for the sake of seeing the
little girl once a week, endure prison for the
rest of his life? All the outdoor freedom
would then be denied him. He couldn&#8217;t walk
around, nor perform before people in the circus;
he couldn&#8217;t even crawl under a pile of
canvas or a clump of bushes to sleep. He
would always be behind those iron bars.</p>

<p>He remembered how Old Lion had complained
of the monotony of life in the cage,
and Old Lion had grown old and weak in
doing nothing. Spot, Ocelot and Timber had
never become reconciled to their captivity, but
paced their cages day and night longing to
escape.</p>

<p>Buster drew a great sigh, and glanced out
of the window. He saw green trees, smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
fields and tinkling brook. Ah, how he loved
those! No, he could not leave them forever.
He started for the outside door as if to leave
the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him out, Nell,&#8221; the little girl&#8217;s
father said. &#8220;The men and dogs are out there.
Do you think you can get him down the cellar
for the night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa, he&#8217;ll come with me,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you, Buster?&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster nodded, and followed her. He had
no wish to go outside and fall in the hands of
his pursuers. So he meekly followed the little
girl down the stairs to the cellar where he was
safe from all his enemies. It was a wide,
roomy cellar, and Buster felt quite content
there, but the thought that the men might call
for him on the morrow to take him away to
the Zoo spoilt his happiness.</p>

<p>When the little girl left him, he had made
up his mind. Before morning he would break
out of the cellar and escape. There had come
into his mind a vision of the woods where he
had been born, and a great desire to find his
way back. Could he do it? In the next
story you will hear how he set out on his long
journey, and what happened to him.</p>

<span class="smcap">Buster Returns to the North Woods</span></h2></div>


<p>Buster spent the rest of the day in the cellar
of the house where the little girl lived, sleeping
part of the time and playing with his little
friend whenever she had the time to come
down. There were many things in the cellar
that smelt good&mdash;jams and jellies stored away
in a closet, potatoes, apples and cabbages in
bins, and boxes full of dry groceries&mdash;but
Buster did not touch any of these. He ate
what the little girl fed him, and nothing else.</p>

<p>As the day dragged along, and night approached,
he thought more and more of the
North Woods where he had been born. He
saw the beautiful river that flowed past the
cave, heard the tinkling of the waves and the
songs of the birds, and sniffed the fragrance
of the millions of wild flowers. He thought
of his mother, who had mourned his death&mdash;of
Loup the Lynx, who had driven him from
home, and made him an exile.</p>

<p>And the more he thought of these things,
the more anxious he was to return to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
woods. He was not needed in the circus now.
Chiquita had gone, and he would never find
another trainer like her. The little girl was
his friend and loved him, but he could have
no home with her. Then the place for him
was in the woods where he would be free to
roam about and hunt as he chose.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when the little girl said
good-night to him. She kissed him on the
tip of the nose, and Buster felt a desire to take
her in his arms and hug her. But he knew
that would never do. His gentlest hug might
break her little bones and kill her. So he contented
himself with a smile and grin, and
waved a paw to her as she closed the door.</p>

<p>Buster ate the supper she had brought down
to him. He felt that he needed it all for his
great journey. It might be days before he
could get another such supper. It was quite
dark outside when he had finished.</p>

<p>But there were lights upstairs and sounds of
voices. Buster sat down and waited until they
had all gone to bed, and the house was as quiet
as a mouse. Then he got up and began preparing
for his escape. The windows were out
of the question, for they were too small for
him to crawl through. So he devoted himself
to breaking through the outside door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>This was locked, but Buster leaned his
heavy weight against it until the lock creaked
and then snapped. The door sprung open so
suddenly that he tumbled outside all in a heap.
The night was clear and quiet. The noise
made by the bursting of the lock did not seem
to disturb anybody, and Buster started across
the fields in a slow jog trot.</p>

<p>When he reached the border of the swamp,
he skirted the edge instead of plunging
through it. He finally came out on the road
where he had frightened the man carrying a
basket of pies and rolls. He smiled at the
remembrance of it, and wondered if the man
would come again with another basketful of
good things.</p>

<p>Buster had started out with the intention of
finding his way back to the North Woods, but
he soon found himself in a quandary. Which
way should he go to find them? And how far
off were they?</p>

<p>He might have been compelled, after all, to
return to the little girl&#8217;s house and go to the
Zoo for the rest of his days, if he hadn&#8217;t
stumbled by accident upon Sleepy the Opossum
cuddled up in a crotch of a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Sleepy,&#8221; he called, &#8220;can you direct
me to the North Woods, and tell me how far I
must travel to reach them?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>&#8220;Follow the wind, Buster,&#8221; replied Sleepy,
&#8220;and travel day and night until you get there.
That&#8217;s all I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind was blowing from the north, and
after traveling in that direction all night,
crossing fields, woods and swamps, he came
to rest in a dense thicket. &#8220;I&#8217;ll sleep here,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;until night, and then go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t want to show himself in the day
time, and so he slept soundly all day. When
he stretched himself toward sundown, he saw
Curly the Skunk nearby watching.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is it to the North Woods, Curly?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;And which way do I go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s far again as you&#8217;ve traveled, Buster,&#8221;
was the reply, &#8220;and it will take you twice as
long to reach it, for there&#8217;s a big river to
cross. Follow the moon, and you won&#8217;t miss
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster thanked him for this information,
and as there was a bright moon he had no
trouble in keeping in the right direction. As
on the previous night he traveled until the
dawn of a new day, and then once more sought
refuge in a dense swamp to sleep.</p>

<p>He was awake bright and early, rising before
the moon was up. This time he asked
Washer the Raccoon, who responded
promptly:</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8220;Follow the trail made by White Tail the
Deer until you come to the river. Then cross
it, if you can. It&#8217;s a long swim, and I wouldn&#8217;t
like to undertake it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Buster thanked his little forest friend,
and resumed his hard journey. He was pretty
tired and dirty by this time, for he had walked
through swamps and thickets of briars in the
dark, and had fallen and stumbled a number
of times. But he had to reach the North
Woods where he would be in no further danger
of capture. Now that he had decided to
return to his old home, he wasn&#8217;t going to be
turned aside by anything.</p>

<p>He reached the bank of the river by dawn.
It was certainly a wide river, and very swift.
He walked in it and drank his fill of cool, refreshing
water. Seeing Billy the Mink washing
himself on the bank, he called to him:
&#8220;Must I swim the river to reach the North
Woods, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly must,&#8221; laughed Billy, &#8220;unless
you can fly across. You haven&#8217;t wings
yet, have you, Buster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then taking a plunge in the deep, swift
stream, Buster began his long swim. The
current was so strong that it carried him far
down from the point he had in view, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
times it seemed as if he wasn&#8217;t making any
headway at all. His long tramp in the woods
began to tell on him, and he puffed and
grunted as never before.</p>

<p>But he was a powerful swimmer, and in
time his feet touched sandy bottom on the
other side. He waded through the shallow
water until he stood on dry land once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, Buster, you look like a drowned rat!&#8221;
exclaimed a voice in the bushes. He turned
to see Groundy the Woodchuck smiling at
him. &#8220;When did you arrive?&#8221; continued
Groundy. &#8220;And how big you&#8217;ve grown! I
hardly knew you at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far am I from the North Woods,
Browny?&#8221; Buster interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far? Why, as far again as half.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no time for joking, Browny. I
want a plain, straightforward answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then you&#8217;ll have it. You&#8217;re there
now! You&#8217;re standing in the North Woods!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buster gave a little sigh of relief. So he
was back home, in the woods where had been
born! How good the trees and bushes looked
and smelt! He sniffed the pines and spruces.
He looked at the river he had crossed, and for
the first time realized this was the stream that
passed the door of his old home. By following
it up he could come to the cave where his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
mother had lived, and where Loup the Lynx
had found him that day when he tried to kill
him.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bobby&#8217;s Introduction</span></h3>


<p>There are many squirrels living in the
North Woods, but only one real Bobby
Gray Squirrel, and if you saw him once you
would never mistake him for any other. Bobby
was a gay, rollicking happy-go-lucky fellow,
who believed in enjoying himself today and
letting the morrow take care of itself. He
wasn&#8217;t exactly lazy, but he didn&#8217;t believe in
doing work that wasn&#8217;t actually necessary,
and sometimes, I&#8217;m afraid, he forgot to do
what was really necessary.</p>

<p>Bobby had many friends in the woods, and
they all liked him and smiled at him, but
there were some who thought his careless
ways might get him in trouble some day. So
instead of chattering pleasantly with him, they
shook their heads and preached to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get busy these pleasant
days, Bobby, and store up food for the
winter?&#8221; Gray Back the Weasel asked reprovingly
one bright, sunny day.</p>

<h3>STORY I<br />

<span class="smcap">White Tail&#8217;s First Lesson</span></h3>


<p>High among the timberland of the North
Woods White Tail the Deer was born, and if
you had stumbled upon his home in the thickets
you would have been surprised by a noise
like the rushing of the wind, and then by a
very remarkable silence that could almost be
felt. The first was made by Mother White
Tail as she deserted her young and took to
quick flight.</p>

<p>White Tail, crouching low down in the
bushes, so still that he scarcely moved a hair,
would hide his beautiful head in the branches
and leaves like an obedient child. Left alone
he knew that his one chance of escape was not
to move or whimper or cry.</p>

<p>That was the first lesson White Tail was
taught by his mother&mdash;to keep absolutely
quiet in the presence of danger. When he
was so small that he could hardly hold up his
head, she whispered to him: &#8220;Listen, White
Tail! When I give the signal that the hunters
are coming, you must flatten yourself down</p>

<p>There was once an old woman who had so
many rabbits that she hardly knew what to do.
They ate her out of house and home, and kept
the cupboard so bare she often had to go to bed
hungry. But none of the rabbits suffered this
way. They all had their supper, and their breakfast,
too, even if there wasn&#8217;t a crust left in the
old woman&#8217;s cupboard.</p>

<p>There were big rabbits and little rabbits; lean
ones and fat ones; comical little youngsters who
played pranks upon their elders, and staid, serious
old ones who never laughed or smiled the

<span class="smcap">White Tail Jumps Stepping Stone Brook</span></h3>


<p>White Tail grew rapidly in size and
strength, his long, clean limbs showing taut
muscles and great springing power; and his
neck grew thick and short, which is well for a
buck, who must use it in savage thrusts when
the head is a battering ram. His horns were
short and bony, but they protruded in front
like knobs against which it would be unpleasant
to fall.</p>

<p>But his antlers were his pride. They spread
out fan-shape on his head, crowning it with
a glory that made Mother Deer supremely
happy. At times it seemed as if the antlers
were too heavy for the head and neck, but
White Tail carried them easily, and when he
shook them in sport or anger any one could
see they were just fitted to him.</p>

<p>In time he stood as high as Father Buck,
and a head taller than Mother Deer. The
day the tip of his antlers reached an inch above
Father Buck&#8217;s, he felt a little thrill of pride.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
